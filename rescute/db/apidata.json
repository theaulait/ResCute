Sepulveda Blvd. El Segundo, 90245 12-4:30 Woof !! <br /><br /><br /><br /><span style='color: #0000ff;'>Talk about survival . . . Sable wins the prize for most Spunk ! <br /><br />While at the Shelter to rescue Roy &amp;#40;also on Petfinder&amp;#41; we met Sable who was Roy's kennel mate. While taking Roy out of his cage for adoption, Sable took advantage of the small opening and 'literally' jumped in to my arms - full body leap ! I asked the Animal Control Officer about this precocious pup and sadly learned that she was to be euthanized in 2 days as they were at capacity. Still in my arms, I looked in Sable's eyes, back to the caring Animal Control Officer - both of them pleading silently - and even though we had no place to board her, Sable became part of our rescue group ! How could we resist such a plea. At just 3 years old, this precious Pointing Lab and Am Staff mix is about as nice as they come. With a beautiful 'seal' colored coat, Sable is truly a beautiful girl. Sable loves other dogs, loves to go to the dog park and is attracted to all black pooches, but 'everyone' is her friend. Oddly, English Bulldogs appear to be smitten with Sable ! Sable is in a loving foster home with a loving and intelligent companion, Perry. Perry is teaching Sable how to be a 'proper' lady, but can't quite get the coquette out of the girl ! While 14 months, Sable is still the puppy and soaks up training like a sponge - full of puppy mischief - all is forgiven when Sable gives you her tummy and looks you in the eyes. <br />See Sable Live on Good Day LA : <br />http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/InsideFox/Detail&amp;#63;contentId=1900047&amp;amp;version=2&amp;amp;locale=EN-US&amp;amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;amp;pageId=5.2.1<br /><font color='#0000ff'> <h4><span style='color: #008000;'>If you are interested in meeting this dog, please call Elizabeth at 310-995-1221 or email her at pitstoprescue&amp;#64;ca.rr.com.

        "description": "The vet couldn't believe we got Nikki from a pound ! This absolutely gorgeous and stunning girl was dumped at the pound because she and her Mastiff sibling got into a fight - A shelter favorite, they were determined to give Nikki a 2nd chance with the help of a qualified rescue. The minute we saw Nikki, we agreed to take her. Only 3 years old, Nikki has been part of the MPSR group since November 2007. Nikki now shares her home with a Poodle, another Pit Bull, a Chihuahua &amp; a Pekinese. Still unskilled at dog etiquette and too protective to allow her to be part of a multi dog home, we prefer to call Nikki 'Dog Intolerant' - and are looking for a home where she will be your one and only. Nikki is super affectionate, intelligent, athletic and can jump a 5 foot wall as if she is floating. Nikki loves her walks, car rides, but most of all shadowing you around the house striking a pose ! <br /><br /><h4><font color=green>If you are interested in meeting this dog, please call Elizabeth at 310-995-1221 or email her at pitstoprescue&amp;#64;ca.rr.com.

As comforting as that old pair of slippers one refuses to part with, the snuggly sweater from a few seasons passed &amp;ndash; this little girl will make you think of times when things were a bit more simple, life less complicated.&amp;nbsp; Miss Willow touched our hearts when we heard from one of our volunteers of a little Mommy that had 3 wee ones and who was being abused by her current Guardian.&amp;nbsp; Thankfully, the pups weren&amp;rsquo;t with the man long enough to have endured what Willow did and stayed true to the sweet nature Mommy passed on genetically.&amp;nbsp; Willow is in a foster home where she plays with other dogs, goes for long power walks, cuddles on the sofa in her very special bed and now never knows a harsh word or action.&amp;nbsp; Willow is quickly adapting to the world as a kind place and is very bonded to Foster Mom who has shown her only kindness while also bolstering her confidence.&amp;nbsp; Willow learned that the best defense is a good offense, but after just a few weeks, now looks to foster Mom to watch her back.&amp;nbsp; Willow is about 5 years old, 9 pounds, in good physical shape and now is ready to find her dream home.&amp;nbsp; Willow is an intelligent, loving and beautiful little spirit who is truly the epitome of a &amp;#42;<strong>rescue</strong>&amp;#42; pup grateful for the smallest act of kindness with a heart as big as her ability to forgive.</span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;2944682&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

So, until I can find a situation, I will have to see that he comes to no harm.&amp;nbsp; He is currently at the vet's getting wormed and receiving his shots.&amp;nbsp; I don't know his breed or exactly how old he is.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Hobbs thinks he may have some Australian shepherd in him by the look of his ears.&amp;nbsp; He is very friendly and gets along with other dogs &amp;#40;even our male dog, who is very territorial&amp;#41;.&amp;nbsp; He is not yet neutered.&amp;nbsp; He has lots of puppy energy, but seems bright and trainable.<br /><br />We really can't keep him for long.&amp;nbsp; We already have two dogs and four cats, all of them former strays.&amp;nbsp; You know how much it costs to properly care for animals and as my husband and I are both school teachers we don't have a lot of extra cash.<br /><br />He weighs 35 pounds and is about 9 months old &amp;#40;acc. to the vet&amp;#41;.&amp;nbsp; He has had his first shots and been wormed, has tested negative for heartworms and begun <br />preventative treatment, and is also on Frontline.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;was not&amp;nbsp;neutered when found.&amp;nbsp; He is as tall/long as his adult growth though he will likely fill out more.&amp;nbsp; We do not know the mix of breeds that produced him, but he is lean and fast and can JUMP.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#40;Someone who wants a dog who can catch frisbees or jump through hoops would <br />love him.&amp;#41;<br /><br />I have taught him to fetch, and he does, in his own fashion.&amp;nbsp; He still has a lot of energy, and that makes it hard to instill discipline, but I'll do what I can.'</span></span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;1468110&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He is looking for a special family that will work with him to feel comfortable&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;them.</div> <div>1/19/09 Dan is still looking for a forever home. He is a sweet dog but is still a bit afraid of people but has come a long way. He loves to be in the house with the humans. He will curl up on a dog bed and take the world in as it passes him. He will now come over and give kisses to a human's hand. But he still needs to do things on his time. He will not let you catch him when he is out but will come in when you ask. He would love to a someone who would walk him on a leash then bring him in the house to relax. If outside he works hard as a guard dog. You will know if someone is coming or a squirrel decides to pass by. He says he is just doing his job protecting everyone in the house. His foster home feels safer with him in it. 8/28/08 I am still looking for a home to love me. I am a sweet dog but needs time to learn to trust people. I am great with other dogs. Update 8/18/07 - I am coming out of my shell a little bit. I love being in the house with people. I still love to play with the other dogs as well. My sister Ann and I were wondering through a neighborhood. We were scared. The fleas and ticks covered our body were driving us crazy. A great family with kids were able to coax us into their backyard with food. We were skinny and hunger. They got the fleas and ticks off of us and w were very grateful. I am the more timid one. I am sweet but I am a bit afraid of people. I love other dogs and now feel safe enough to play. I love Ann but will play with others if she is busy. If you adopt me you will need to realize I will need to learn to trust you. I love kids if they are nice to me. I will make a great friend if you dare to take a chance on me.</div> <div>WE FINALIZE EVERY ADOPTION WITH A HOME VISIT THEREFORE POTENTIAL HOMES MUST BE WITHIN A HOURS DRIVE TIME OF CHARLOTTE NC.

        "description": "<p>SISSY is a young Pit mix who was found as a stray in Cecil Co. The SPCA there will not put Pit Bull up for adoption so her good samaritan rescuer brought her to us rather than have her face certain death. We are not sure if she was neglected or on the run for some time but she came in very thin. We are still getting to know here but this is what her foster Mom says so far:</p> <p>'Sissy is very sweet, the tail never stops wagging. She will not make eye contact with you, and keeps her head down while you pet her &amp;#40;wagging the whole time&amp;#41;. She went right into the crate last night and layed down. She was unsure if she was allowed to come out when the door was open. Shaun left the crate door open all night, but she stayed in it. She's in&amp;nbsp;his room in the basement, and she has full run of the room, but seems to go back to the crate when no one is around. She appears to be housebroken, no accidents and she always goes as soon as we take her out..&amp;nbsp; She is a little lovebug- just burries her head in your lap &amp;amp; wags her tail.'</p> <p>She has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped &amp;amp; tested heartworm neg. Will post more info as we get to know her. Adoption &amp;#36;165.

It's too bad that I don&amp;rsquo;t live in England because I'm sure I would have a family to love and protect and a life style that is befitting my name!&amp;nbsp; I joined Rescue almost two years ago and because of my good looks, I was quickly adopted.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the day after I was adopted, my family decided to show me off at this big party with dogs and kids and lots of people.&amp;nbsp; There was so much going on.&amp;nbsp; So many people, so much noise, so much commotion.&amp;nbsp; I was absolutely overwhelmed!&amp;nbsp; When I am overwhelmed, I am not always on my best behavior.&amp;nbsp; I'm sorry but I just can't help it.&amp;nbsp; A few weeks later a nice volunteer took me to her home where I met and got along with other dogs and her daughter.&amp;nbsp; But again there were so many parties and all these &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; kept coming over the house.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I was overwhelmed.&amp;nbsp; And I thought I had to protect my human mom from all those people who made all that noise.&amp;nbsp; The next thing I know, I was back in the kennel.&amp;nbsp; Again.&amp;nbsp; I am not a puppy.&amp;nbsp; I am not looking for a wild and crazy home!&amp;nbsp; I am an adult dog and I am looking for a nice, quiet family who will give me a chance to be the good dog that I know I can be.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am obedient and quite self confident.&amp;nbsp; I am house broken and I LOVE riding in the car with my humans.&amp;nbsp; You can ask any volunteer or dog in the kennel and they will tell you that I am a very nice dog.&amp;nbsp; All I need is an established family where the humans will respect my space and give me guidance, direction, and mentoring.&amp;nbsp; I am lucky to be invited to the Coastal swim party almost every Friday. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy swimming as much as some of the other dogs but I do enjoy the bone munching session.&amp;nbsp; I was told that I am very pleasant company to both dogs and humans when we are there.&amp;nbsp; So, please check me out!&amp;nbsp; I might not be a duke in British royalty but I am handsome, affectionate, and loyal.</p> <p>Please visit<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span><a href='http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/'>http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/</a><span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span>to learn more about our dogs.

This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100&amp;#37; tax deductible.</p> <p>Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.</p> <p>Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.</p> <p>We show our dogs at adoption events<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span>every weekend!

She was living under a pontoon boat during the sweltering summer. She obviously had had recent puppies somewhere but we couldn't find them. It took weeks to gain her trust. She was with a male dog who was very leery of people. When they finally were able to get out of the situation, they were admitted in our vet for avaluation.&amp;nbsp;</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>I am not sure how to finish out this story because I am still shocked at what was found after she finally realized that some people are really 'good' and that she had no reason to be afraid. She is currently in foster care along with others and she is such an inspiration to have around. She is the perfect dog. There is a puppy around her and that pup drives her crazy but she doesn't mind at all. This dog is the definition of RESCUE. She was a throwaway. People saw her roaming and just ignored her or, worse.....were cruel to her. Now she is WONDERFUL! She loves life and she loves people.&amp;nbsp;</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>She is going to need to go an adopter that is wanting a best friend. She cannot be banished outside. You can tell she wants to be right next to her people all the time.&amp;nbsp;</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>She has been promised a wonderful life from this day forward. I do believe she would be the perfect therapy dog candidate.Laid back, calm, and lovable.</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>She has been spayed, hw negative, dewormed, and current on her vaccinations. She had demodectic mange but it has been treated. She also had lots of worms but ALL GONE.</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>PLEASE check on any possible pitbull bans in your area before applying. If you are not sure, please mail me Trisha.&amp;nbsp;</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>trisha&amp;#64;pawfirst.com</div> <div style='text-align: center;'>Rah Rah's adoption fee is &amp;#36;125 to help cover some of her vet expenses.</div> <div style='text-align: center;'><strong>The first step in adopting one of our pets is filling out an adoption application at www.PAWFirst.com</strong></div> <div><strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong></div> <div style='text-align: center;'><strong>After your application is approved, we will schedule an appointment for you to meet the animal you are interested in.

Minnie had her cataract surgery one week ago and yesterday she had her first follow up visit. We are very happy to tell you that she is recovering from her surgery as we had hoped and expected. The stitches in her eyes have been removed and she definitely is seeing again. She'll have to use the cone for two more weeks but then our diabetic girl will be ready to attend adoption events and look for her forever home. Many thanks to everyone who donated to her medical fund. Your help and support of Rescue made Minnie's surgery possible. We think we can hear her singing more lyrics, '<em>Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind, It's gonna be a bright, bright sun shiny day!' &amp;#40;Lyrics by Johnny Nash&amp;#41;</em></div> </div> <p>Please visit<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span><a href='http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/'>http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/</a><span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span>to learn more about our dogs.

A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.</p> <p>We show our dogs at adoption events<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span>every weekend!

He's been living in a foster home so we'd like to tell you about him. In his foster home, there are other dogs and he gets along with everyone. He wants to play and he can be a bit loud, rowdy, and pushy. Of course, in their own way, the other dogs says 'No' and Artemis, in his own way, talks back. Maybe it is how an adolescent dog says, 'Make me!' There are cats in his foster home and he's okay with them. He wants to chase and play but he'll back off when a cat stands up to him. Artemis is good with his basic commands but he does need continuous training and reminders of good doggie manners. He needs a firm but gentle hand and will respond to verbal corrections. He will talk back at times though so the phrase, 'Make me!' does happen from time to time. Artemis will bark at people when they come in the door &amp;#40;unless he is in his crate in which case he'll be quiet&amp;#41;. In fact, he does well in a hard crate and his foster mom says he is improving greatly with the wire crate. Did we tell you that he loves Nylabones&amp;#63;&amp;#63;</div> <div> <div>Artemis has epilepsy and experiences grand mal seizures. He currently takes Phenobarbital and other medications may be added as he continues treatment. Treatment does not cure the condition but is aimed to decrease the frequency, severity and duration of the seizures. Artemis may be called a 'special needs' dog but if you are the right family to welcome him into your life, you should know that his foster mom describes him as 'a big love'. Because he has spent time in our kennels as well as the foster home, we should tell you that Artemis has a fan base. One of his weekly dog walkers is a young woman who is currently deployed to serve our country. She regularly sends messages, asking about Artemis, and she is counting the days until her return so she can visit and hug him!</div> </div> <p>Please visit<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span><a href='http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/'>http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/</a><span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span>to learn more about our dogs.

They should be able to be treated very cheaply. As of now, he has had some hair loss that is slowly returning. Wynter is my foster dog and he is a wonderful dog. I think he will make a wonderful addition to any family and I don't want him to miss that. If you are willing to work with this kiddo, please let me know :&amp;#41;<br /><br />Why am I&amp;nbsp;here&amp;#63; I was dumped in front of a school in the middle of a snow storm. How could you&amp;#63;</div> <div>My foster mom tells me everyday how I&amp;nbsp;am such a good boy. She says all I&amp;nbsp;need is for someone to give me a chance. I&amp;nbsp;am always happy. She makes me smile whenever my name is called. I&amp;nbsp;love it here and I know she will make sure that I&amp;nbsp;get a wonderful home where I will have my very own family. Oh&amp;nbsp;did I&amp;nbsp;mention that I will do just about anything for some neck scratches. They feel sooooo good.</div> <div>&amp;nbsp;</div> <div>How did I&amp;nbsp;get in this situation&amp;#63; Someone dropped me off in front of&amp;nbsp;West Middle School. I&amp;nbsp;played and played with all the kids but when school started, I was left there all alone. That is when I&amp;nbsp;saw a car and a friendly face so I&amp;nbsp;knew that was where I&amp;nbsp;needed to go. It was really really cold outside so this lady started calling me Wynter. She gave me a soft pillow, a warm bed, and even FOOD. I&amp;nbsp;was so hungry that I&amp;nbsp;gulped it all down. I&amp;nbsp;have learned since then that&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;will never have to worry about my next meal.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;have seen little dogs&amp;nbsp;come and go.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;am just waiting for the day when it will be&amp;nbsp;MY turn. Can YOU&amp;nbsp;be my family&amp;#63; I&amp;nbsp;promise to love you always!</div> <div>&amp;nbsp;</div> <div>Wynter's adoption fee is &amp;#36;40 and&amp;nbsp;he is completely updated on all his medical needs. We have had him neutered, given him all his shots, and he is parasite-free. He is also current on his heartworm preventative. He will definitely need to be a primarily indoor dog. He is an amazing house dog.

But after a while, she settled down and enjoyed herself.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s asked to come back next week.&amp;nbsp; Of course, the wonderful marrow bone that was waiting for her after her swim session was really nice!&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>Please visit<a href='http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/'>http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/</a>to learn more about our dogs.

        "description": "<p>Aisin was a feral &amp;#40;wild&amp;#41; dog living outside a factory in London, Kentucky. Born in the wild, she had no social interaction with humans. Factory workers left food scraps outside for her until the factory owners decided to have her shot. A local animal rescue organization, Homeward Bound Canine Rescue and Rehabilitation, trapped her to save her from being killed. Aisin arrived at the rescue frightened, unsocialized and missing much of her fur from mange. She was scared of the kennel environment and was transferred to World Animal Foundation for rehabilitation. Aisin arrived terrified of humans and hid under a bed for several days, refusing to eat or even move. She trembled and defecated if&amp;nbsp;anyone came close to her. After several days she began to come out of hiding for food and water at night when no one was around. After several weeks she slowly began to take treats from humans. After a month she gained the courage to go outside during the day and slowly began interacting with other dogs. Aisin is now house broken, plays with other dogs and follows humans around. She begs for treats and now plays with toys. She will let her caretakers touch her, but is&amp;nbsp;still shy and cautious. She is terrified of a leash but volunteers are slowly working to leash train her. She needs&amp;nbsp;a patient family willing to continue to work with her. Whoever adopts her will need to understand that she&amp;#39;ll probably start off shy and timid. She&amp;#39;s very gentle, likes other dogs and does well with cats. Aisin is about 5&amp;nbsp;years old, spayed, wormed,&amp;nbsp;current on vaccines and microchipped.&amp;nbsp;Her hair is almost all grown back in and is now soft and shiny. Aisin is a special dog who deserves to live. She is very low maintenance and will require a fenced yard and other dogs to interact with.&amp;nbsp;Her adoption fee is &amp;#36;150.00.&amp;nbsp;If you are interested, please contact Homeward Bound at 859-490-0486 or e-mail homewardbound1818&amp;#64;yahoo.com.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5421694&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Myers, Sarasota, Tampa, St. Pete, Lady Lake, The Villages, Orlando, Ormond Beach, Melbourne, etc. Rosie &amp;amp; Posy would be great with children, an active, athletic adult or both. Approximately 9 months old, they are loaded with energy and enthusiasm and need lots of attention and training. They adore each other, love other dogs and people, love to run and play. Need lots of daily exercise. Posy is larger than Rosie - you can see that they're sisters but they don't really look alike. They are desperate for attention and affection and should do beautifully with someone who has lots of time, energy and love to share with them, someone who knows dogs and has some training experience. These sweet little girls are desperate for a home of their own.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;3227438&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

She was adopted out, but unfortunately, Grace's adopter could not keep her due to her work schedule.&amp;nbsp; She was adopted out again, but poor Grace was once again returned - after SIX YEARS - due to a change in her owner's living situation.<br /><br />Grace is good natured, and fun, fun, fun. She has lived with a cat, and she's good with most dogs, but she loves people most of all.&amp;nbsp; Grace will make a wonderful pet, but she does need an owner who understands that dogs need to know who's in charge - she's quite clever and quickly figures out who will let her be boss - and that dogs love stability and do best with consistency.<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;17802&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Jessie was wandering the streets when a kind animal lover discovered her. No tags, collar or any method of identifying her owner was found. GSROC could not bear the thought of this beautiful girl alone and on her own.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>She is approximately 3 years old and has a quiet nature. She is quiet and somewhat unsure around strangers right now. Jessie is not sure exactly what has happened to her and she is uncertain.</p> <p>Recently we introduced Jessie to some cats. She let us know in no uncertain terms that she is not a fan of felines! Due to her reaction, we believe she would do best in a home with no small dogs or cats.</p> <p>We are just getting to know Jessie and will update her profile shortly.</p><br /><br /><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,sans-serif' mce_style='font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;'><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 12pt' mce_style='font-size: 12pt;'>Please go to our website and complete an adoption application at: </SPAN></SPAN><A style='FONT-FAMILY: ' href='http://www.gsroc.org/application.asp'><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,sans-serif' mce_style='font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;'><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 12pt' mce_style='font-size: 12pt;'>http://www.gsroc.org/application.asp</SPAN></SPAN></A>.<SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,sans-serif' mce_style='font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;'><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 12pt' mce_style='font-size: 12pt;'> An adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.</SPAN></SPAN><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5739904&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Meet Chandler. He is a seven year old Chihuahua who is a very sweet and loving dog. He loves to cuddle and is a pretty mellow dog. He mostly just hangs out all day and is wonderful with people and very good with kids.&amp;nbsp;He would prefer to be the only dog but with a proper introduction, he should be&amp;nbsp;fine with a brother or sister to&amp;nbsp;play with. &amp;nbsp;He has no health issues or medications.&amp;nbsp; He is fixed and walks well on a leash. He is potty trained but as with most little dogs, he will have an accident if left inside too long. At our house he is trained to go to the bathroom in a specific area in our yard. He is a sweet heart with people and wants to cuddle in blankets all the time.</p>  <p>Please contact Jaclyn <font face='Arial' size='2'><a href='mailto:jaclynfowle&amp;#64;yahoo.com'>jaclynfowle&amp;#64;yahoo.com</a> if you are interested in meeting Chandler</font></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5848946&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Chocolatte &amp;#40;aka Choco &amp;#41; is a 2.5 year old chocolate lab mix. He, his sister Lissy and his mom Nanny Duck were found in a junk yard, starving and scared. Now, &amp;nbsp;Choco is a big lovebug! He is a big guy and is very active. He loves to play and does well with most other dogs, even little dogs. After a day of playing, he loves to snuggle on the couch with his people. He has passed a basic obedience class and loved it, and would do well in continuing classes. He &amp;nbsp;would prefer a home without little children, because he doesn't know how big he is. &amp;nbsp;Choco is neutered and up to date on vaccinations.</p> <p>All the adoptable AARF dogs are in foster homes to get them ready for their forever homes.

They are also microchipped, fully vaccinated and treated for parasites. Adoption fees vary from 50&amp;#36; to 350&amp;#36;. Application and home check required prior to adoption.</p><br /><br /><p>Vyse is a handsome, 3 year old Pit Bull. He is a realy nice, well behaved boy. An easy keeper. Would be best as an only pet but would love&amp;nbsp;a family with kids. He is the perfect companion for an active family who likes movie nights in front of the tv. He is housebroken, crate trained, leash trained and knows basic commands. And the icing on the cake is his unique and beautiful coloring. He does have some minor skin issues that are being sorted out. But is otherwise a healthy boy.

class='MsoNormal'>Meet Lilly. Lilly was picked up by animal control as a stray. She was adopted from animal control and they just loved her but a neighbor said 'Oh my goodness, that's a pit bull!!' and the family brought her back. REALLY!!! Lilly is just the sweetest dog you can ever meet. She is good with other dogs, absolutely loves, loves, loves, kids and is a great dog. Please consider adopting Lilly into your family. Don't let the 'bad rap' prevent this awesome girl from getting the family she so deserves!!</p><br /><br /><p>All of our pets are current on vaccinations. Dogs are heartworm tested. Kitties are FIV/FeLV tested. All are spayed/neutered, on flea, tick and heartworm prevention and micro chipped. Our adoption fee for dogs is &amp;#36;180.00. Our adoption fee for cats is &amp;#36;100.00 and if you adopt a second cat at the same time the adoption fee will only be &amp;#36;150.00 total.</p><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5753739&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>PRINCESS was dumped at a high kill shelter in NYC when her owners moved overseas. She is a really good, loyal dog. At 5-7 yrs old, she is well past the puppy stage - yet still an active girl. Princess LOVES toys - kongs, tennis balls, you name it! Gets along with other dogs - but doesn't like to share her toys. LOVES the great outdoors &amp;amp; hikes &amp;amp; especially STICKS! Would do best in a home with older kids, a laid back other dog or fine as an only dog as well. Prefers a 'cat free' home. Princess has been spayed, vaccinated, heartworm neg and microchipped.

His basic needs of food and water were met, but he never got to experience the outside world. No trips to the park, no car rides, little if any affection. His world consisted of his yard and seeing his people.</span></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>&amp;nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>His family decided they no longer wanted him and asked GSROC for help. When we learned of plight, we rushed to help him.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Zeus is now slowly learning about the outside world. Although he is obedience trained, his trainer has worked with him and he is slowly learning that humans can be friendly and fun.

I am her foster mom though and the name Spot works here :&amp;#41;&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>Spot&amp;nbsp;is a pretty girl who was saved from out local animal control the day that her time was up. We actually went in to pull another dog that day but she was just sitting there so nicely. She had to be saved.&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>Spot is a very sweet girl. VERY. She will gently nudge you for attention. She needs to be an indoor dog. She would not be happy outside and there is no reason to keep her outside anyways since she is kennel trained.&amp;nbsp;She wants her family there with her all the time. If you sit somewhere, she will sit next to you. If you walk to the next room, odds are that she will not be far behind you. She gets along wonderfully with children. She also gets along with almost all other dogs in her foster home &amp;#40;too many to mention haha&amp;#41;. She will answer any challenges though from a couple&amp;nbsp;dominant females in her home so that should be taken into consideration be any potential adopters. If you have a very dominant female, she may not be the best candidate for your new family. Other than that, not too many flags.&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>A privacy fence would be ideal because she could definitely get over&amp;nbsp;a chain link fence if she wanted.</p> <p>Spot is&amp;nbsp;current on her vetting. She is completely vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested &amp;#40;negative&amp;#41; and spayed.</p> <p>Spot's adoption fee is &amp;#36;100.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5364401&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

That&amp;#39;s a fitting description of our boy Solo! </strong><br /> <br /> Solo is a truly STUNNING boy, with one blue eye and one brown eye! But his looks are just a PLUS on top of all his other great qualities!<br /> <br /> Solo has TONS of personality and is very outgoing with people. He&amp;#39;d love to be someone&amp;#39;s constant companion... on car rides and outings, hikes, dates - you name it! He&amp;#39;s always &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; for anything! In his foster home, he enjoys playing fetch, playing with toys, SNUGGLING, or just laying quietly by his foster mom&amp;#39;s feet. &amp;#40;ok, maybe that last part is after a busy day!&amp;#41;<br /> <br /> This boy is highly intelligent, and very eager to learn. He is very food motivated, which makes training a fun and easy task with him! And he always wants SOooooo much to please!<br /> <br /> Solo is quite an active boy and needs a family who is active, wants to spend a lot of time with their dog, and will provide him with regular stimulation and exercise. In his foster home, he enjoys spending lots of time romping, wrestling, and playing with the other dogs, so we believe he would do best in a home with another dog for companionship and a fenced yard for off-leash play is a must. &amp;#40;Solo does not always get along with male dogs, so ladies only please!&amp;#41;<br /> <br /> He does not have a lot of&amp;nbsp;cat experience or experience with children. For this reason, he should not be placed with cats or children under the age of 10.<br /> <br /> All Solo&amp;nbsp;needs is a great family to share all of his cool characteristics with! So if Solo strikes you as the fun-loving, wonderful companion that we know him to be, please inquire!</span> </span> </p>  <p> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'> <span style='text-decoration: underline;'><strong>Placement Requirements:</strong></span> </span> </span> </p>  <ul> <li> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>fenced yard</span> </span> </li> <li> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>female canine companion</span> </span> </li> <li> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>active family who spends a lot of time with their dog</span> </span> </li> <li> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>no children under the age of 10 years</span> </span> </li> </ul><br /><br /><p><strong> <span style='font-size: 18pt;'> <span style='color: #000080;'>How To Adopt Me:</span> </span> </strong></p>  <p> <span style='font-size: 18pt;'> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'><strong>Step 1</strong>:&amp;nbsp; First, p</span> </span> </span>  <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>  <span style='font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;'>  <span style='color: #000080;'>lease be sure you have read this pet&amp;#39;s <strong>entire</strong> description in order to decide whether this particular pet is a good candidate for your family.&amp;nbsp; We try to include as many details as possible about each pet, including the type of placement needs and requirements they have for adoption.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</span> </span> </span> </p>  <p> <span style='font-size: 18pt;'> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'><strong>Step 2</strong>:&amp;nbsp; </span> </span> </span>  <span style='font-size: 18pt;'>  <span style='color: #000080;'>  <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>Be sure to read our <a href='http://careforanimals.rescuegroups.org/info/display&amp;#63;PageID=8072'>adoption policies and procedures</a> before contacting us.</span> </span> </span> </p>  <p> <span style='font-size: 18pt;'> <span style='color: #000080;'> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'><strong>Step 3</strong>:&amp;nbsp; <a href='mailto:care4pets&amp;#64;msn.com'>E-mail us</a> to request an adoption application and/or inquire about this pet.&amp;nbsp; </span> </span> </span> </p>  <p> <span style='font-size: 18pt;'> <span style='color: #000080;'><strong> <span style='font-size: 12pt;'>&amp;nbsp;</span> </strong></span> </span> </p> <br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;2075060&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He would have stayed there if he hadn't been so vocal and one of our friends heard him from a couple of blocks away. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Prancer is a CHARACTER. He loves to play and go on walks. He's a very sweet boy. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Prancer will need some work on transitional housebreaking. He is okay on leash.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp; Prancer would do best in a home with another dog or with someone who is home all the time. He does not like to be left alone. He is not recommended for apartments or condos because he is noisy when he is alone :&amp;#41; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Prancer is fantastic with other dogs and with cats. He would be great for kids over 10 years of age. Prancer is a 'dog park dog' as he loves to go there :&amp;#41; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application.

        "description": "<p><br /> <u><b>Foster Homes Urgently Needed!</b></u> <b>PUP is always in need of loving, caring, and committed foster homes</b>. The more fosters, the more dogs we can pull and rehome. As a PUP foster, you would care for and socialize the dog while that dog&amp;#39;s ideal, permanent home is found. You may also be involved in some of the transport functions &amp;#40;e.g., vet, groomer, training facility&amp;#41;, as well as the adoption process. PUP pays for all approved food, accessories, and vetting expenses. We are a non-profit, small/toy breed dog rescue service organization. We work locally and nationally with shelters, other dog rescue organizations and individuals, to help these wonderful dogs. Some of the dogs may never have had a kind word spoken to them, a gentle gesture shown to them, a healthy meal given to them, or a visit to a vet to find out what was wrong with them. We need you and our dogs need you! <b>Without our foster homes we cannot save dogs.</b> We do not have a facility; we are solely a foster home program. Our foster volunteers are truly the backbone of PUP. Their participation is critical and very much appreciated. Why become a PUP foster&amp;#63; Because you love dogs and would like to surround yourself with other people who share the same passion. PUP fosters and their families are an amazing group of people and we are so grateful for each and every one of them! <b>If you are interested in becoming a foster for PUP,</b> please visit our Volunteer page to download an online application: <b><a href='http://www.pupdogrescue.org/volunteer.html' target='_blank'><font color='#cc0000'>PUP Volunteers</font></a></b><br /> <br /> Complete and email to: <font color='#660033'><b><a href='mailto:info&amp;#64;peopleunitedforpets.com' target='_blank'><font color='#cc0000'>volunteer&amp;#64;pupdogrescue.org</font></a></b></font></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;3584844&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

But they were leaving town for the holidays and he works a job where he's away 3 or 4 weeks at a time and his wife is in school, so no time but lots of reasons why she cannot stay........So she came into rescue just as skinny as can be, kind natured and rolls around and plays with all the others and loves to play with puppies! &amp;nbsp;She also has a side of her that will NOT be trespassed upon and she will tell that to them in NO uncertain terms, she is a darling little spit fire! &amp;nbsp;She doesn't usually start anything, but will try to finish it. Her only truly bad habit is chasing the cats - she shrieks and runs them up onto something. Though not sure what she thinks she'd do with one if she caught it, since they are all bigger than her, LOL!</span></div> <div id='yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1390162932793_6080'><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>&amp;nbsp;</span></div> <div id='yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1390162932793_6083'><span id='yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1390162932793_6082' style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;'>Keely is super sweet and loving and she is a tough cookie, wanting to be a full time companion more then anything. &amp;nbsp;She never misses out on anything and likes the car, and I have a hard time getting out the door without her, even to go to work. She has more spring than I have ever seen in a dog her size - her vertical jump must go 4 or 5 times her height! Straight up into my lap without the feet ever touching till they land. If I clap my hands she will run and jump into my arms sometimes too! She is a sweetheart and I can't believe anyone would ever have abandoned her. This is a very special little dog.</span></div><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6544676&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

She is well-socialized with dogs, cats and people. You can see her playing with her friends in the yard -- as we said -- she is very well socialized. Missy also likes to do her impersonation of Winston Churchill or Groucho Marx, she won't tell us which she's doing with her rawhide but there ya go. <br /></span></p> <p class='p1'><span style='font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;'><strong>ADOPTION NOTES:&amp;nbsp; </strong>The Hemingway Group provides a special environment for our companions. To insure successful adoption -- there are several things we look for. &amp;nbsp;First, the companions at the Hemingway Group are well socialized and used to playing and being with other dogs on a constant basis. Therefore, adoption in most cases should be to a home that already has 1 or more playful &amp;amp; active companions, or adoption of 2 companions from the Group is recommended. This is not an absolute requirement, several of our adoptable companions would do well as an &amp;ldquo;only pet&amp;rdquo; but most of our companions would not do was well. Next, our companions are indoor/outdoor dogs and used to running free in large -- very large -- fenced areas for most of the day. Your yard need not be acres large, but clearly a good sized fenced yard or very close dog park and your time to take them regularly is needed. We believe in the Ceasar Millan approach to human and animal behavior, <a href='http://www.cesarsway.com/'>click here</a> for more information. Lastly, we are a small organization -- it is difficult to support any adoption out of state as we require your pre-visit with the companion, our home visit to your location and finally your pickup of your new companion.

We are just across the town line from Bedford, and we need some help caring for puppies and the occasional mama dog.  If you have a free hour to two hours to give weekly &amp;#40;or any time at all -- find some friends and each take one 'shift' per month!&amp;#41;, please consider giving of your time to help these sweet puppies get walks, playtime, and love.  Pups are between 8 weeks and six months of age, generally. Heavy duty cleaning is handled in the morning, but light clean-up, putting food out, cleaning water bowls, etc., as needed is also required.  Retired couples or individuals most welcome!  Come play with the pups -- you'll get paid in soul-refreshing puppy kisses and adoring gazes.  Love puppies but don't want to start over with a tiny puppy of your own&amp;#63;  This is a great way to get some great laughs out of puppy antics!!!

All of the dogs have been treated for mange and are recovering. Jacy's fur is trying to grow back in but it will take time. This doesn't stop him from being playful and happy!

        "description": "<p>DOB: June 2005 &amp;#124;&amp;#124; BREED/COLORING: Australian Shepherd and Rhodesian Ridgeback mix - red &amp;#40;he has one blue eye and one brown eye&amp;#41; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; SIZE: Bloo weighs about 40bs and is full grown &amp;#124;&amp;#124; HISTORY: Bloo was dumped at a City Shelter by his family in late 2005. We saw him at a big adoption event and decided to get him out of the shelter before he was euthanized. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; PERSONALITY: Bloo is an amazing boy. He is very sweet and smart and absolutely LOVES to be petted and brushed. He makes gurgling noises when you scratch his neck and he's just waggy and friendly all the time. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; TRAINING: Bloo knows SIT and is great on leash when he has a good handler. He will need some re-work on his housebreaking, but is so smart it won't take long. He is also great with a crate - so he could be crate trained really easily too. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; WOULD DO BEST: Bloo would like a yard for sure - maybe even another doggie to hang out with. He would do great with someone who has at least some experience with dog training - and would probably REALLY do well at agility training. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Bloo has been around indoor cats his whole life and is indifferent to them. He is great with other dogs on a one-on-one basis - but isn't recommended for dog parks because he will try to referee any doggie argument that takes place :&amp;#41; Bloo would make a FANTASTIC family dog for homes with children. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit our website: http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/ &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Make a donation to help us continue to save lives: http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;448198&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>DOB: September 2010 &amp;#124;&amp;#124; BREED/COLORING: Bull Terrier mix; black/white &amp;#124;&amp;#124; SIZE: Karma weighs about 65bs and is full grown &amp;#124;&amp;#124; HISTORY: Karma's name is Karma for a reason. She was found running the streets in the rain by an employee of our vet's office when she was 3 months old. The vet's office named her Lluvia &amp;#40;rain in Spanish&amp;#41; and they had to send her to the shelter in case her family was looking for her - so they sent us her impound number to follow up with her and get her out. We could not find a foster for her and were unable to help her. Two months later one of our volunteers was at the shelter and met this really sweet Bull Terrier mix and took a photo of her cage card with the intention of networking her. Lo and behold, the name on the cage card was LLUVIA - it was the same dog! We got her out and named her Karma. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; PERSONALITY: Karma is really super goofy and cute. She bounces around and loves to play and run with other dogs. She's not the brightest bulb on the tree - but that quality is really endearing in her. She is super well behaved when she gets enough attention. She is a volunteer favorite. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; TRAINING: Well, Karma has been in a couple of foster homes and now she is in a kennel, so she will need work on her housebreaking skills. She will also need work on her leash training and could really benefit from some basic obedience. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; WOULD DO BEST: Karma would do best in a home that doesn't expect her to fetch the newspaper because she will forget about the newspaper halfway to it. She just wants a place to run and chase balls and play and be goofy - and get some lovin too. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Karma could do great with another dog that doesn't bully her and just wants to goof around - she LOVES to play. She is GREAT with cats and would be fantastic with kids. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit our website: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/</a> &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit us on Facebook: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome'>http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome</a> &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Make a donation to help us continue to save lives: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</a><br /><br /></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;2391294&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>DOB: January 2011</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>Breed/Coloring: Catahoula Leopard Dog Mix</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Size: Brenna weighs about 55lbs and is full grown</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;History: Brenna and her littermates were dumped at a Ventura shelter when they were three months old by a backyard breeder. We rescued them from there right before they would have been euthanized.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Personality: Brenna has a LOT of energy and is very sweet with people.</p> <p>She can be very affectionate and is SUPER willing to please people.</p> <p>She is very smart and would do well with proper training - maybe even some Agility Training :&amp;#41;</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Training: Brenna has not really had much opportunity to be trained because she has been kenneled most of her life. She will need work on housebreaking, basic obedience, and leash. We strongly recommend starting her off with crate training and an in-home consultation with a trainer. We are prepared to lower her adoption fee to offset the cost of an in-home trainer. As smart as she is, we don't think that it will take her long to become a fantastic member of any household.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Would Do Best: Brenna would do best as an only-dog in a home with a large yard space. She needs a family that will spend time on her training and that has some experience with training a larger, young dog. Please read about her breed and their needs here:</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/catahoula.htm'>http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/catahoula.htm</a></p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Vet Record :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Cats, Dogs and Kids: Brenna cannot be with cats or other dogs because of her breed and prey drive. She would be great with older children that could withstand her energy level and size because she will want to PLAY PLAY PLAY.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Availability: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application.

From there she was rescued and now she needs a home of her own.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Iris loves people and LOVES to be petted and to sit quietly with people.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: We do not know yet if Iris is housebroken - but all rescue dogs will need some work. She is okay on leash, but needs more walks to be confident.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST: Iris must have a yard. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Iris would be okay with children. We do not yet know how she is with cats or other dogs. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area.

While she waited there for a new home, it became apparent that she was pregnant. They scheduled her for euthanasia, so went and saved her life - and she gave birth to two puppies the very next day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY:&amp;nbsp;Zelda is waggy and playful with other dogs, but is quite fearful of people. She was obviously neglected and/or abused. It takes her some time to warm up to people... but she's not mean or nippy, and acts happy and waggy, she's just a nervous girl. She needs TLC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Zelda is doing FANTASTIC in her foster home with housebreaking. She uses pee pads during the day, and when the door to the patio is open she goes potty outside without fail.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Zelda needs an adult-only quiet home and would really do best with at least one other small dog in the home.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS:&amp;nbsp;Zelda is GREAT with other dogs &amp;#40;LOVES other dogs&amp;#41; and with cats. She is not recommended for children because she is so timid. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area.

        "description": "<p>In May 2007, this cute guy was the popular dog with the Athens County Humane Society volunteers! When they sent the list of dogs who were scheduled to be euthanized, Hank was top of their list, and they pleaded for someone to rescue him. OPP quickly adopted Hank into a family with another dog and grandkids. Hank was not a good fit for this family because they did not know how to respect his space when he was eating or chewing on a bone. Some dogs don&amp;#194&amp;#146t mind if you mess with them, however, others like their space&amp;#194&amp;#133just like with people. When he was returned to OPP, he was significantly overweight, nails too long and clearly stressed. We were glad to get him back! Hank is a fun-loving, sweet dog. His half-tail makes his short body and beautiful brown coat even more adorable. He likes to sit in your lap and receive affection. Hank needs an adult household that will provide him the love and affection he desperately seeks AND allow him quiet time where he can enjoy a good bone without being bothered. And, though Hank is good with other dogs, he prefers to be the only dog-kid so he doesn't have to share. .... Hank deserves to be picky regarding his next home given all that he has been through... Older kids are best for this boy. Visit www.ourpalsplace.org and read notes from Hank's friends - learn why the volunteers love this sweet boy!</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5121837&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

What soulless creature could do this to a defenseless dog&amp;#63; We are inundated with dogs needing expensive medical treatment but we could not say no.</p> <p>Rusty is now safe in our lifeboat and being examined by our vet. His skin is dry and brittle - who knows when he last had a decent meal. His ears are crusty with scabs and wax. He will need IVs, expensive antibiotics and nutrients to restore his health.</p> <p>Can you please help us save this poor boy&amp;#63; Celebrate ADOPT A RESCUE DOG MONTH by donating towards Rusty's care. Click on the sponsor button to send in your pledge.</p> <p>UPDATE: Our vet has told us poor Rusty's ears were clearly a hack job, not done by anyone with skill. Rusty's skin issues are a combination of yeast and bacterial infections caused from an untreated flea infestation. This poor boy clearly has been suffering, He now has a bronchial infection too! Expensive antibiotics and medicated baths are continuing. Your donations and financial support are needed &amp;amp; greatly appreciated! Rusty is very animal aggressive - our vet believes he was used as a fight dog. Extensive training and rehab will be needed before he can be placed in any type of home.</p> <p>All donations are needed!

After 2 weeks my time was up, I was about to be euthanized when&amp;nbsp;my Luck changed, that same very nice man and his wife came to get&amp;nbsp; me. I did understand they could not keep me as they had 2 other dogs and many cats, somehow they knew I am a very smart loving dog that deserved a 2nd chance.&amp;nbsp;I know all my commands, walk well on a leash and I&amp;rsquo;m crate trained. I would do best with larger dogs and No Cats. I am 3 to 4 years old, Spayed and up on all my shots. I promise to love and protect you, always make you happy&amp;nbsp; unconditionally.</p>  <p>PLEASE ADOPT ME</p>  <p>949.702.3334 Kevin</p>  <p align='center'>check out my Video&amp;nbsp; <a href='http://www.vimeo.com/87144859'>www.vimeo.com/87144859</a></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6697291&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

From his trademark ears and wide-eyed look of impish innocence to his gaily wagging tail, this 8 lb. cutie was born to be petted, pampered and played with. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise then, that his favorite activities include snuggling on people&amp;rsquo;s laps, playing with the other dogs &amp;ndash; even the cat &amp;ndash; in his foster home and going for long walks. Although his shy side shows when he first meets new people, he&amp;rsquo;s been warming up more quickly with each new person he&amp;rsquo;s met. Walking well outside on leash, what Chico most enjoys is meeting up with his many friendly neighbors; then, once he&amp;rsquo;s back inside, he races straight for his cache of toys. Potty trained as long as he&amp;rsquo;s taken out often, neutered, up to date with all of his shots and heart worm negative, cheeky and cheerful little Chico is on the hunt for a forever home, preferably one with a canine companion already in residence.

        "description": "<p>Hey there, Jack here! Looking for a place to crash and a friend to share all the good times sure to come our way! I'm a young Jack Russell mix boy, born in the fall of 2011. I make friends easily and enjoy being around both two legged as well as four legged buddies. My foster mom says that I'm real smart and love to please. I hope for a home where I'll have humans who want to play with me cause I love to play. At night, I'll be ready to curl up on the couch and keep my human company. Are you looking for a new best friend&amp;#63; Then we need to meet!&amp;nbsp; I'm neutered, up to date on my shots, and micro chipped.&amp;nbsp; If you're interested in adopting Jack, please call PAWS at 256-383-0690 or complete an application at the website at <a href='http://www.shoalspaws.com/'>www.shoalspaws.com</a>.</p><br /><br /><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 10pt' mce_style='font-size: 10pt;'>To adopt this wonderful pet, complete our online application at: </SPAN><A href='http://shoalspaws.com/adoption/adoption-application/' mce_href='http://shoalspaws.com/adoption/adoption-application/'><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 10pt' mce_style='font-size: 10pt;'>http://shoalspaws.com/adoption/adoption-application/</SPAN></A><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 10pt' mce_style='font-size: 10pt;'> Once we receive your application, our adoption counselor will review it and contact you as soon as possible.

He has excellent manners and is shy in new surroundings. He is good with other dogs and his best friend in his foster home is a male English setter. He is good with people.</p>  <p>He is not a digger or climber. He sits on command, comes when called.</p>  <p>Sampson needs a fenced yard in which to be able to run. He would do best in a home where there is someone home a lot and give him lots of attention.</p>  <p>He is UTD on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative and on heartworm preventative.

        "description": "<a href='http://justinbartlettanimalrescue.org/animals/detail&amp;#63;AnimalID=4519690' target='_blank'>See Kiwi's Homepage</a><br />Go to <a href='http://justinbartlettanimalrescue.org' target='_blank'>our official website</a><br /><br /><font color=red>You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.</font><br /><br />I'm Kiwi the little chihuahua dachshund mix and I'm so excited to enjoy the world around me. For almost 8 years, I spent my life inside of a small crate inside someone's home. I was never taken for walks, held or petted. My crate was my bathroom, sleeping area, and eating area. Humans weren't very kind to me.<br /><br />When the day came that someone finally reached in to touch me, I did the only thing I knew to protect myself - bite! I wasn't sure what would await me outside of the only tiny world I knew and I didn't know what it meant to have a hand coming toward me. Thankfully, the human was patient and persistant and finally got me out of the crate. I was given a temporary home where I learned to trust a little more and enoy life outside of a cage and learn what it is like to not be imprisoned.<br /><br />Now, I'm looking for my forever home. A home where I don't have to worry about crates again. I would prefer to be baby gated into a small room where I can feel secure or better yet, just stay home with you all day! I know how to go potty outside now&amp;nbsp; but if left alone for long periods of time will still go inside.&amp;nbsp;I do love to go outside and love the grasson my feet! &amp;nbsp;I get along great with other dogs and I love attention. I probably wouldn't do well with a small child because I get very nervous when backed into a corner and I will resort to the only protection I know--snapping! My rescuers tell me that there are wonderful humans out there. Humans capable of loving me and being patient with me and touching me with a kind hand. I want that kind of human. I want to be free with you to be a dog and learn what it means to be loved just as I am.<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;4519690&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I was found wandering the streets with my buddy Cash, and the nice gentleman brought us here to this fine establishment. I must say that I was quite scared when I came in, but I am starting to warm up to these gentle folks. I especially like to go for my walks, it&amp;#39;s such an adventure and there are some darn tootin&amp;#39; mighty fine smells out there! I have my tail up the entire walk. I also am enjoying all of the love and attention that the volunteers are giving me more and more each day. I am a sweet little guy, and I would love to have a quiet and calm home and family to call my own.

        "description": "<p>Meet Symba!&amp;#126;&amp;#126;He is a 6-years-old Applehead 6 pound toy Chihuahua. Most cats are bigger than him. He has golden medium length fur. Although very fun, sweet and mellow, once he gets to know you, Symba can be very protective his owner with lots of barking. Symba needs to be the only pet at home.</p>  <p>I recently took Symba to the vet. He has all his shots for the year. The vet said Symba&amp;#39;s teeth are not in the best shape and it&amp;#39;s best he eats little kibble size foods that can be moistened. He will come with gentle flea shampoo to be washed with once a week. He will come with a 5 month supply of Frontline.</p>  <p>Please contact Shahlla Sherzoy - <a href='mailto:shahllasherzoy&amp;#64;yahoo.com'>shahllasherzoy&amp;#64;yahoo.com</a><br /> 925-899-0842</p>  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6820299&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>&amp;#126;&amp;#126;I lost my dog after 14 years in December.. A month later my daughters were walking their dog and they found a very scared, skinny dog running in the middle of the street in a Long Beach neighborhood. Dried fesses stuck to his body, mange was evident and his bones were showing through his coat as if he were wearing the wrong size for his body. So sad. A boy stopped to help and was able to get a lease around his neck. The boy&amp;rsquo;s name isNoah. So that is what we named this starving, sad sack doggie. He was sent to the Animal Shelter and my daughter called and said we would adopt him.</p>  <p>I got him at the end of January. Below is a summary of what I know after two months. Sadly, I am unable to keep him. I am at a crossroads in my life and am satisfied that we saved his life &amp;#40;one day from being put down&amp;#41;, but want to make sure the rest of his life is with someone that will love him every day.&amp;nbsp; Please contact Sharon if you are interested <a href='mailto:shenna06&amp;#64;aol.com'>shenna06&amp;#64;aol.com</a></p>  <p>1. He is about 5 years old</p>  <p>2. He is a cuddle bug, loves to cuddle and yes he sleeps with me. I call him my &amp;ldquo;love bug&amp;rdquo;</p>  <p>3. Knows many commands, sit, stay, shake, come</p>  <p>4. Potty and Poop trained</p>  <p>5. Needs a Yard</p>  <p>6. Is okay with other Big Dogs</p>  <p>7. Does not seem to like cats or little dogs</p>  <p>8. Not a barker</p>  <p>9. Not sure about kids as he has not been near any</p>  <p>10. Is a Lab/Retriever mix, with a bit of Pit</p>  <p>11. Loves water and loves to have his belly scratched</p>  <p>12. Needs lots of love and patience</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6828037&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>This boy, along with many other little dogs came to rescue as the result of a mill-type breeder cruelty confiscation.&amp;nbsp; He was very underweight, had trouble digesting regular dog food and was heartworm positive.&amp;nbsp; He also had a mouth full of teeth that were either loose or rotting in his gums.&amp;nbsp; When the vet completed the dental and removal of infected teeth, Loki had only his two upper canine teeth left.&amp;nbsp; He was put on a prescription bland diet of soft food and he began to thrive.</strong></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>Unlike most dogs that come from living in cages all their lives and being used only for breeding, Loki craved the attention of people.&amp;nbsp; At the shelter where he was housed, he would bark constantly for someone to pay attention to him.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the people working at the facility would let Loki out of the cage, but that could not be done often enough for Loki...&amp;nbsp; He was adopted once but returned because he would mark on everything in the house and the adopter could not housetrain him.&amp;nbsp; This is not unusual for a dog that has lived 8-9 years in a cage.&amp;nbsp; He was never allowed outside the cage in the breeding operation so he didn't have a clue that inside his cage/home was not the place to potty.&amp;nbsp; Loki stole the hearts of many of the people who worked at the shelter, and one of them started taking Loki home on weekends with her so she could start house training him.&amp;nbsp; While Loki got lots of love and play time with her dogs, he just could not understand what house training was all about.&amp;nbsp; Even after months of working at it, his weekend Mom could not teach him. &amp;nbsp; <em><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'>Loki will never be housetrained</span></em>. <br /></strong></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>Since Loki could not be housetrained, the odds of him being adopted were little to none.&amp;nbsp; He was such a sweet boy, loving everyone, but hating living in that cage so was still barking all the time.&amp;nbsp; Someone in the rescue suggested they should try to find a rescue &amp;#40;preferably Papillon rescue&amp;#41; that fostered dogs in their homes rather than in a shelter.&amp;nbsp; We received an email asking if we could take a senior, heartworm positive Papillon boy who was very beautiful and social but could not be housetrained.&amp;nbsp; They explained that in their shelter he barked all day until he was hoarse, just trying to get someone to come see him and give him a little attention.&amp;nbsp; We said YES, send him to us ASAP because it broke our hearts, too, thinking about this sweet little old man being locked in the cage and barking all day for attention.&amp;nbsp; </strong></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>Loki came to us lean and still on the prescription dog food, but since he was not having any trouble digesting or holding small portions of other food down we put him on a regular soft food diet and he's thriving.&amp;nbsp; He's gained a little weight and even though he only has two teeth, will gobble up kibble if there's any on the floor that he can reach.&amp;nbsp; </strong></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>This little old man is the sweetest, most gentle Papillon I've ever fostered.&amp;nbsp; He's healthy except for the heartworms &amp;#40;which will be eliminated when he is treated&amp;#41;, has great eyesight and hearing and doesn't miss a thing in his foster home!&amp;nbsp; He gets along with all 8 of the other dogs and even tries to play with some of them even though he's the oldest dog in the house.&amp;nbsp; He doesn't know how to play with toys, and he can keep up when all the other dogs zoom around in and outside the house.&amp;nbsp; He's playful, active, agile, and very happy!&amp;nbsp; He can also be quiet and gentle as well.&amp;nbsp; </strong><strong>In our home he wears a bellyband all the time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#40;A bellyband is a rectangle of cloth that is long enough to wrap around the dog's body and cover the part from which the urine comes.&amp;nbsp; We put part of an incontinence pad inside the band and change the pad when it gets wet.&amp;#41;&amp;nbsp; The bellyband prevents us having to clean up when he marks in the house.&amp;nbsp; Poop just has to be cleaned up...</strong></span></p> <p><br /><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>Because his hearworm treatment will take several years,&amp;nbsp;&amp;#40;he tested 3 of 3, which is a heavy case&amp;#41;, he will need someone who will never forget to give him the monthlhy mdication.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He's had such a hard life and loves people so much, he will require a stay-at-home human, a fenced yard and no children under the age of 8, because he's so small and frail he could be hurt by a child falling on him.&amp;nbsp; Having tile floors in your home would be a big plus!<br /></strong></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'>&amp;nbsp;<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;'><span style='font-size: 12pt;

        "description": "<p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Sawyer was a puppy mill release. Guessed at about 3 years old and he weighs 13 lbs. He is shy but making progress in his foster home. He will need a more experienced home and is not for the first time dog owner. He is not house trained but is working on crate training and house training will come with patience and consistency. A belly band helps too. No small children please! He gets along well with the other small dogs but does need to be separated at meal time. He will need a fenced yard or someone committed to keeping him safe with harness and leash walks. No tieing these mill dogs out unattended as it isn't safe. He has now been fully vetted, had a dental, cherry eye repair, neuter, all vaccines, heart worm test and micro-chip. E-mail is ALWAYS our first contact for more information or an application. He is being fostered in the Grundy Center Ia area.</span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5521128&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

She is house trained now, making progress but still very, very shy and a flight risk so please be aware of this before inquiring. 1-15-2013 Just 12 to 14 weeks old Ava has never known the comforts of a home or family. She started her life out on the streets. Read more here http://www.facebook.com/TheForlornDogsOhHughesAr&amp;#63;ref=ts&amp;amp;fref=ts A small Arkansas town is inundated with stray and abandoned dogs. Many are shot by locals, hit on the roads or die from starvation. We wanted to help so Ava and several others made the trip to Iowa. She is still figuring out that all humans aren't bad and will need a securely fenced yard and a doggy friend would be great to help her adjust. She will be available as soon as she is spayed and vetted &amp;#40;done&amp;#41;. Our first contact is ALWAYS e-mail for an application or more information. Note...Please understand how shy she is before inquiring! She is not for the first time or inexperenced dog owner. She requires a fenced yard and a quieter home without small children...for her own safety! She is being fostered near Grundy Center Ia. </span><br /><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>ameow2002&amp;#64;yahoo.com please e-mail directly and don't use the auto response...thanks!</span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5326509&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He has been one very sick little boy. Magoo is in need of a Liver Shunt repair. He was in Tenessee during the month of July but was not strong enough to have the procedure done at that time. He will go back to Tenessee in August to have the repair. Magoo will need a very special family to help him through his long recovery. We are keeping our fingers crossed and saying prayers in hopes that it will be a 'greyt' success.

        "description": "<p>&amp;#126;&amp;#126;LOCATED IN CORONA, CALIFORNIA</p>  <p>Introducing Cinnie: This 2 &amp;frac12; year old female lives in Corona, California. Cinnie is the picture perfect companion. She loves to speak when she is excited, she makes all kinds of vocal sounds! She also likes to talk with her paws! How funny is that&amp;#63;! Haha. This little goofball loves to roll over on her back and do they bicycle! The best part about her is how sweet she is. She will lay on top of you so you can&amp;rsquo;t move, and give you as many pibble kisses as she pleases.</p>  <p>I rescued Cinnie from a vacant house in the middle of the night, during heavy rains. She was left inside of a crate, laying in her own feces. She was in awful condition. Cinnie is now current on her shots and has been spayed. She has had some training and is now potty trained. Cinnie is the perfect companion. She would love to speak with you and can be reached at 951-389-4363.</p>  <p>CONTACT LISA IF INTERESTED IN CINNIE<br /> PHONE: 951-389-4363</p>  <p>&amp;#42;&amp;#42;COURTESY POST DISCLAMER&amp;#42;&amp;#42; Please note that The PBCDR has not met or evaluated the dogs marked as courtesy listings and makes no representations as to their health, temperament, or suitability for adoption.<br /> &amp;nbsp;We assume that all the information provided by the lister is true &amp;amp; accurate, but cannot be held responsible for the animal itself or the animal&amp;rsquo;s health &amp;amp; temperament.<br /> As with all adoptions, the PBCDR encourages potential adopters to gain as much information as possible before adopting these animals, including but not limited to temperament testing, consultation with a trainer, and consultation with a veterinarian.

Tonya is good with other dogs, crate trained.. House broken as long as has scheduled outings. She doesn't do real good with a leash. She seems to be afraid of them. She's ok once you get it on her.

She's pretty laid back..</p> <p>The standard adoption fee is &amp;#36;150, but it may vary depending on the situation and the animal.

He was given to his Foster by the Owner who lived in a Trailer Park and kept him tied up 24/7. Buster is house trained, neutered, fully vetted, heart worm negative, and on heart worm preventative. He loves people and dogs, but has not yet been checked with cats - although there were cats in his yard area in the trailer park. He sleeps inside the house, stays in a fenced yard with 9 other dogs during the day, and is allowed to run free and hunt in the adjacent woods for several hours each day. &amp;nbsp;He goes on long walks in the woods with his foster without being on a leash and likes toswim. &amp;nbsp;Buster has a beautiful hound voice.

She is definitely a people dog and absolutely adores her human companions. When she's around humans, she wiggles her tail so much, the&amp;nbsp;back&amp;nbsp;half of her body&amp;nbsp;wiggles with it! On the other hand, she is not a fan of small dogs&amp;nbsp;or cats -&amp;nbsp;her&amp;nbsp;prey drive is strong. Poet is good around dogs of her own size and larger, but as&amp;nbsp;most dogs do, she&amp;nbsp;would love&amp;nbsp;to be the star of her family.

        "description": "<p>DOB: March 2009 &amp;#124;&amp;#124; BREED/COLORING: Shepherd mix; brown/black &amp;#124;&amp;#124; SIZE: Manny weighs about 60lbs and is full grown &amp;#124;&amp;#124; HISTORY: Manny and his brother were irresponsibly bred by a family with unaltered dogs. We stepped in and got their mom and dad fixed and took the pups to find them homes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; PERSONALITY: Manny is a nervous boy who really tends to bond with women more than men. Once he knows you, he is super sweet and loving and kissy - but he's not the best in public because he feels he needs to 'protect' his handler. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; TRAINING: Manny will require some basic obedience to boost his confidence - as well as continued crate training to be 100&amp;#37; housebroken. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; WOULD DO BEST: Manny needs a yard to run in that does not have street access &amp;#40;he will be very protective of the yard if he can see the street&amp;#41;. He needs a dog-savvy handler that is willing to show him the ropes as well as rub his belly. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Manny is good with another dog if he is introduced properly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In his current foster home he is with a female pit mix and also gets along with the foster's own dogs. &amp;nbsp;He is great with cats and would be okay with older children. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit our website: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/</a> &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Visit us on Facebook: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome'>http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome</a> &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Make a donation to help us continue to save lives: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</a></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;1021341&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Ricky is capable of jumping any fence known to man, so he needs to be walked on a leash. He walks nicely on a leash, and is perfect for someone with an active life-style. He is SUPER smart, and would make a good hunting/fishing companion. He is protective of his home and owner, and is an excellent judge of character! He has a very comical nature and is the source of many laughs at the shelter.

They are part of the Rockin' P Rescue program. Can you believe that they were found at one of the high-kill shelters&amp;#63;! They were rescued and lived in foster homes until we could find a new family for them. We are in desperate need of quality families in the AL/GA area to temporarily care for boxers waiting for their forever homes. Currently, we are having to turn dogs away from our program because we have nowhere for them to go. This could ultimately mean these dogs will be put to sleep. Fostering a boxer is a truly rewarding experience - please open your door, and your heart, to a boxer in need. If you cannot foster and have a large crate you'd like to donate, please let us know! We can use it to save a life! Send an e-mail to rockinp&amp;#64;microxl.com for more info.</font><br /><br /><p><span><strong><em>Not ready to adopt me&amp;#63; &amp;nbsp;How would you like to be my sponsor&amp;#63;!&amp;nbsp; Our&amp;nbsp;medical bills are at an all-time high and even a &amp;#36;5 donation can help take some of my cousins off the street, treat their wounds and heal their hearts.&amp;nbsp; Please think about a tax-deductible donation today!</em></strong></span><br /><br /></p> <p><a href='https://secure.paypal.com/xclick/business=angie&amp;#37;40rockinprescue.org&amp;amp;no_intl=1&amp;amp;return=http&amp;#37;3A//www.rockinprescue.org' target='_blank'><img src='http://images.paypal.com/images/x-click-but7.gif' alt='Make payments   with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!' width='72' height='29' border='0' /></a></p><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;98507&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

During the middle of divorce the wife left her sitting alone in the house that was sold.</p>  <p>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bare knowing she could go to the pound and possible kill shelter so I took her in with hopes someone would adopt her out. We have rescued her and gave her a loving family for the past six months.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately I already have a 80lbs pit-bull &amp;amp; 7lbs Yorki so we are unable to keep a third pit bull dog. Lola originally cost &amp;#36;2k and the family spent an additional &amp;#36;4k in boarding and training her. She gets along with all children &amp;#40;I have a 3yr old&amp;#41; as well as other dos &amp;#40;my 7lbs Yorki &amp;amp; 80lbs pit-bull&amp;#41;. Only took one week to acclimate her with my other two dogs. She is so playful and a loving dog. She listens to commands and will cuddle with you all night if you allow. Lola is approx. 50lbs, 6yrs old and a beautiful blue color &amp;#40;picture does not due her justice&amp;#41;. We need to find her a home ASAP as we cannot afford to lose our home due the additional dog. I only have until the end of this Tuesday, June 17th&amp;nbsp; to find her a home. It make me sick to even think about taking her to a shelter and her having to wait for a home!</p>  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>  <p>Please contact me if you are interested .

Her right leg was swollen and she could not bear weight on it. One of our amazing volunteers picked her up and brought her to their home but they can only keep her there temporarily. Even though we did not have any room in our organization, we could not turn our backs on her. Grace was seen by the vet, we had x-rays done and it was said that she was struck by a snake. Grace is healing nicely and is ready for a long term foster home until she is adopted out.</p>  <p>Please consider opening up your heart and home to this beautiful girl. www.dontbullymrescutexas.org/adopt</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7104426&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He gets along with other dogs but we are not sure how he would be with cats. He was adopted when he was about 1 year old then 'divorce' happened to his humans and he was returned to his rescuer. He was house trained at that time but has lived outside in a kennel for the past year or so and we are not sure how he would be now. Most dogs that have been house trained in the past are usually easily re-trained once they began living inside again. Kenny is a beautiful dark brindle with white sox and chest with a stripe runing down the middle of his face and around his nose a lot like the boxer. The attached picture is a little out dated and Kenny has put on a little weight due to lack of exercise as his rescuer does not have time to take him for walks or trips to the local dog park for exercise. Kenny's adoption fee is &amp;#36;75 and a home visit is required as part of his adoption process.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6049686&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Louie is one of five hoarder dogs we rescued from a great organization in kentucky. This group rescued 23 dogs from a horrible hoarder situation. All of the dogs have been treated for mange and are recovering. Louie&amp;#39;s fur is trying to grow back in but it will take time. This doesn&amp;#39;t stop him from being playful and happy! Louie is about 2 years old, maybe younger. He is a bit shy and could use that extra special home to teach him its okay to be a dog and play all day. Please think about giving this wonderful little boy the happy home he so deserves!!! Email sheplover5&amp;#64;aol.com for more information or an application to adopt. you can also download an application at www.foreverhomerescue.com. Louie is up-to-date on vaccines, on heartworm/flea preventative and will neutered. A home check is required to adopt. Louie&amp;#39;s adoption fee is &amp;#36;300.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6336298&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>&amp;#126;&amp;#126; We are trying to find Kief &amp;#40;4 years old&amp;#41; a home, foster or a rescue. He needs someone pit savy as Kief had no socialization except with the small child that bothered with him. He has not had any training, but is eager to learn. He is a total love bug. He is all puppy at 4 years old. Now that he has been introduced to life. Jeff who rescued him has no money. He paid to spring him from the shelter and to have him neutered. He has been with friends of Jeff&amp;rsquo;s for 7 weeks and they can&amp;rsquo;t keep him any longer. He needs to be out this weekend. We have been networking him like crazy. No one will help. I have begged so many rescues in CA and surrounding states. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. It breaks my heart he might be going to the shelter this weekend where you know he will be killed just for being a pit. This poor dog that is so sweet just needs someone to love him. That he is part of the family not a lawn ornament. Where he gets lots of love, attention and exercise. He is located in Sana Ana, CA Kief is a 4 year old White Pit bull with black spots. He has one Blue eye. He is a total love bug! Here is Kiefs Story: Kief, was Jeff&amp;rsquo;s neighbor&amp;#39;s dog. He jumped the fence and was picked up by animal control. The neighbors said they weren&amp;rsquo;t retrieving him! The shelter was going to kill him just for being a pit in the next couple of days. Jeff could not let this sweet dog die in a shelter and spent every penny he had left to bail out Kief. Kief was neutered a month ago. He is used to small kids as the people that owned him have a small child. Jeff can not keep him as his own dog is aggressive to other dogs. Jeff would not let him die in a shelter! But he is out of options as of this weekend. Jeff is looking for the perfect home for this sweet boy!

        "description": "I'll smother you with kisses!<br /><br /><p>Hi--I'm Nevada! I was found as a stray in a southwest neighborhood here in Houston. People in the neighborhood kept seeing me, and I was clearly far away from home and alone on the streets. They think I was just dumped there. Thankfully, a kind foster stepped in and got me off the streets and into an adoption program. I'm a love bug; I love to be around people and love to give kisses to everyone I meet. When I'm being walked, I want to say hello to everyone I meet along the way. I'm good with other dogs and also love to give other dogs kisses, too. I'm one of the most affectionate dogs you'll ever meet.</p> <p>I'm well behaved in the car and like to lie down in the back seat when the car is moving and look out the window. I enjoy walks and will also make a wonderful running or jogging buddy. I love my foster doggie brother and we play for hours on end--I'll make a great companion for another doggie who enjoys playing. I'm a snuggle bunny and just a love and enjoy being with my person and doggie brothers.</p> <p>I'm a young, energetic American Pitbull Terrier/American Staffordshire Terrier mix. I have a gorgeous chocolate, faint brindle coat that is so unique. I'm about a year old and great with people and kids and other dogs. Probably I will do best in a home without cats. I want to chase them, not to hurt them but they don't like being chased by me. I've been spayed and micro-chipped and am up-to-date on shots. I'm a smart dog who wants to please and such a fast learner and the sky is the limit with what you could train me to do. Like most all young dogs,I'll benefit greatly from an owner who will invest in obedience training with me. I'll make a loyal and loving companion for some lucky person.</p> <p><strong>Please contact us at&amp;nbsp;<a>adoptions&amp;#64;rescuedpetsmovement.org</a>&amp;nbsp;for more information on this pet or visit&amp;nbsp;http://www.rescuedpetsmovement.org/adoptions/adoption-form/ to fill out our adoption form.</strong></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7022656&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

We have jobs and families and don't have 'regular business hours'. For this reason, we don't show the dogs until an application has been submitted.

        "description": "INTERESTED IN FOSTERING A SPRINGER FOR ESRA&amp;#63;  The Foster Home program is the most important aspect of ESRA's organization. Our Foster Homes provide immeasurable assistance to our Springers by providing them with housing, medical care, rehabilitation, exercise, and love. Frequently dogs that are in our Foster program have previously been in stressful and sometimes abusive situations and the Foster Home environment gives these dogs time to heal their wounds and gain confidence in their relationship with others before they go on to permanent placement.  Fostering can lead to adoption - the choice is yours. It can be a chance to experience life with a Springer before making a long-term commitment.  ESRA Foster Homes are screened, placing dogs only in homes that are approved as responsible and reliable.  All dogs will be spayed and neutered, fully vaccinated, and tested for heartworm while in foster care.   To graduate a dog from foster care to permanent placement is a success and a happy ending made possible only by ESRA's foster home members!  If you would like to foster a dog for ESRA, please complete a Foster Home Application &amp;#40;http://www.springerrescue.org/join/foster_form.html&amp;#41;.     Please contact our MN/IA/ND/SD coordinator for information.

She is playful and smart. She knows sit, stay and shake. With practice she is sure to learn more tricks. She needs to be in an adult home that doesn&amp;#39;t get many visitors &amp;#40;or all the same people&amp;#41; because she does not like being approached by strangers, and usually takes a few meetings to warm up to people. Once she trusts you she is a giant cuddle bug. Preferable to have&amp;nbsp;a home without other animals as she has never been around cats, and is selective with dogs. She has resource aggression and needs to be fed separately. She is potty trained, and walks well on a leash. With a patient and committed family Patches would be a great companion.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7262403&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

We believe there may be some greyhound in her. She is a fun loving girl who is very affectionate towards people.<br />We originally came to find Pepper when she was tied to a park bench in February and left overnight at just 8 months old. She was put through the TAGS program we managed to find her a great family home. That is where most TAGS's stories end, but unfortunately, Pepper's TAGS' story continued. <br /></span></span></span></p> <p><span><span style='font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>A few years ago while playing in her backyard, Pepper had a run in with a Coyote. Although the Coyote never actually got to her, Pepper was chased through the screen door into the arms of her family. Unfortunately, since then, the poor girl is a bit wary of some dogs &amp;#40;but not all - her best friend is TAGS dog Bart&amp;#41;. Pepper puts on an act that is big and tough in order to keep other dogs away. Because of her fear &amp;#40;and her display of how bad to the bone she can be&amp;#41; Pepper was brought back into the program.<br /><br /><br />Because of her past, Pepper is a people person. She loves to meet and play with new people, however, when other dogs are brought in the mix, she puts on her show and scares the other dogs &amp;#40;and people who don't know her&amp;#41; away. With some love, patience, and training, Pepper would make an extremely loving companion.</span></span></span></p><br /><br /><SPAN style='FONT-SIZE: 10pt' mce_style='font-size: 10pt;'><STRONG style='FONT-FAMILY: '><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva' mce_style='font-family: verdana,geneva;'>Please note that the animals in our program are available for adoption only&amp;nbsp;to individuals located in the Region of Durham area; however we are always happy to refer you to a rescue or shelter in your area.

Rusty can sometimes be a bit cautious when meeting new people, but once he knows you he is very loving and loyal. He does well with female dogs and some male dogs are ok too. Rusty is ok with cats and should do fine with some farm animals. &amp;nbsp;We say Rusty is not house broken, but he does not go potty in his kennel area if let out into the play area or walked. Rusty walks very well on a leash. He is very smart and willing to learn so I don&amp;rsquo;t believe housetraining would be an issue. &amp;nbsp;Rusty would do best in a home with adults &amp;amp; older children. Rusty is active but not hyper he requires some exercise but not as mush as a younger dog. Some play time in a fenced yard or just a nice walk would be enough and the he could be couch potato. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a great dog that is out of the puppy stage and would be loving and very loyal please consider adopting Rusty.</span></span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt;'><span style='font-family: book antiqua,palatino;'>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Rusty go to </span></span><a href='http://www.olivebranchwv.org/'><span style='font-size: 12pt;'><span style='font-family: book antiqua,palatino;'>www.olivebranchwv.org</span></span></a><span style='font-size: 12pt;'><span style='font-family: book antiqua,palatino;'> and fill out an online application.

During that time, I've been neutered, gotten up to date on all my shots, and then I had to have one of my eyes removed. That's not going to slow me down at all! You can see in my photos how my eye looked before surgery, and how I look now as I'm healing. When the scars have faded, I'll be a handsome boy who looks like I'm giving you a permanent wink!</p> <p>I'm a one year old Stafford Terrier mix. I weigh about 59 pounds--a big bundle of love! I get along with other dogs. I also love people, including older kids. In my foster home, there are two large dogs and two kids ages seven and nine. I do have one flaw--I don't really get along with cats and need to be in a home without any.</p> <p>Other than with cats, I'm super sweet, and would lick the face of everyone I meet! So what about it&amp;#63; Do you think that you and I could meet and that you might be the one to give me my forever home&amp;#63;</p> <p><strong>Please contact us at&amp;nbsp;<a>adoptions&amp;#64;rescuedpetsmovement.org</a>&amp;nbsp;for more information on this pet or visit&amp;nbsp;http://www.rescuedpetsmovement.org/adoptions/adoption-form/ to fill out our adoption form.</strong></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7217185&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Meet Legacy foster Ms. Mulligan! When Mulligan first arrived into foster care it was evident she hadn&amp;rsquo;t lived a very good life. She was under weight, scared and had no &amp;ldquo;Boxer spirit&amp;rdquo;. It took a few weeks, but after some regular meals and lots of loving Ms. Mulligan is discovering what the good life is about! This little girl is a prime example of why Legacy does what it does! As Ms. Mulligan continues to come out of her shell her Boxer spirit has begun to return! In fact, we are learning that she&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of sweet and a whole lot of sassy! In fact, she has earned the nickname &amp;ldquo;Ms. Sassy Pants&amp;rdquo;! Ms. Mulligan loves her daily walks and does great on a leash! While she&amp;rsquo;s cruising the neighborhood she likes everyone to know she&amp;rsquo;s out and about! Who knew such a loud bark could come from such a little thing! She&amp;rsquo;s also the sweetest little girl that loves nothing more than to be curled up in your lap or next to you on the couch. Each time you walk into the room she&amp;rsquo;ll greet you with the fastest moving Boxer nub you have ever seen! In fact she gets so excited the back half of her body just wiggles and wiggles! Have you even seen what&amp;rsquo;s often referred to as the Boxer Kidney Bean&amp;#63; Well, you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a kidney bean until you see Ms. Sassy Pants do it! Mulligan is cat friendly and kid friendly but is somewhat selective about her dog friends. Because of this she would prefer to be an only dog. She&amp;rsquo;s crate trained and almost house trained. We&amp;rsquo;re still having a few accidents in the house but that&amp;rsquo;s ok because she&amp;rsquo;s still learning! Ms. Mulligan is looking for her fur-ever home. Her fur-ever family needs to know she&amp;rsquo;s had a bit of a rough life and will need a little love and patience. The positive side to this is she is the sweetest little girl and has a lot of love to give in return! Could this be the girl for you&amp;#63; How can you resist that face&amp;#63; If you would like to meet Ms. Sassy Pants please contact Legacy.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>If you are interested in adopting me, please fill out our <a href='http://www.savetheboxers.com/adoptionapp.php'>adoption application</a> to begin the process.</p> <p><strong>If you aren't able to adopt at this time, please consider making a much needed, tax-deductible donation to Legacy Boxer Rescue by clicking <a href=' http://savetheboxers.com/donate.php' target='_blank'>here</a>.</strong></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6578785&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Much as the Kithara was played to accompany dances and epic recitations, Kitara the pup was made to accompany you on life&amp;rsquo;s many epic adventures! Kitara is the embodiment of a faithful sidekick, and her favorite pastime is following her favorite people around like a happy little shadow. Kitara is estimated to be around 2 years old and roughly 50 pounds, and she is truly one of the mellowest and easygoing girls you will meet. She knows how to go to the bathroom outside, and walks very well on a leash. When she&amp;rsquo;s not enjoying daily walks with volunteers, or following her favorite humans around, Kitara likes to lay back and people-watch. This beautiful lady has a short and easy-to-care-for coat, a reassuring smile, and lovely brown eyes. If you are looking for a sweet, friendly, and laidback gal, then Kitara is definitely worth a visit! </span> </span> </p>  <p> <span id='docs-internal-guid-6a34db4d-b2ba-2074-c9cb-dc6b5669ce9b'> <span style='font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb&amp;#40;255, 255, 255&amp;#41;;'>If you&amp;#39;d like to provide Kitara with the loving home he deserves, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoption-application.

Like many with that genetic combo, though, Widget is deaf. He has got some vision, but not very clear, and he is sensitive to bright sunlight so he should not be exposed to it for long periods of time. Widget is a high-energy boy who likes to play and run. He is a bit jumpy if he doesn't see someone coming, which is natural considering he can't hear anyone approach. Widget has a sweet nature- he likes to give doggie kisses and cuddle when he is in one of his relaxed moments. Widget is a large boy and is also vocal &amp;#40;he can't hear himself bark&amp;#41; so he is not a good choice for young children or apartments. Widget's foster is working with him on sign language. He is a smart boy and learns fast, but he is a youngster so it will take time and consistency for him to master them. In short, Widget is a good boy, a happy, energetic pet, and needs an adopter who will understand and appreciate him for what he is!<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5934982&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He has had an eye injury but just adds to his unique and regal look. Jerry is young and trainable and does well with praise. Jerry learns commands quickly but didn't come with a lot of practiced social behavior. He is willful and spirited, and takes pride in 'getting it right'. Jerry is a bit possessive of his owner and is still being taught that he doesn't need to be over-protective. With an experienced owner and patient but consistent reinforcement he will become the best pet ever! He is young, handsome, and ready for a lifetime of loyal loving; Jerry may just&amp;nbsp; be the one for you!<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6179039&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Toby's foster family has been working with him for some time now and he has improved, but he is still very much a work in progress. Toby will need an adopter who can continue to work with him. He is young enough to learn and just needs proper direction, patience, consistency, and love. Toby would do best in a calm, predictable environment. In a perfect world, Toby's adopter would be willing to consider working with a behaviorist to help him be as successful and happy as he deserves to be. Toby is a good boy and it's not his fault his previous 'owner' didn't help him learn to be a pet. Help Toby learn to love being someone's special somebody!<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7081766&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "&amp;#40;Jessie in Photo has already found his forever home &amp;#41; BUT..We are currently needing some friendly people to volunteer for these Departments:   Foster Homes, transporters, Adoption Center and fundraisers.   I can send you an application  in the event one of these would work out for you.You can fill it out and return via email. We can also keep it on file for 6 mos if something else should come up that would be of interest to you.   FOSTERING: We take in small dogs, puppies, cats and kittens to foster. The fosters DO NOT pay out of pocket for expenses while Fostering any animals in our Rescue. This is a Misconception of many folks. The Rescue pays for everything necessary. We also accomodate for time away. Some of our best fosters have been the winter visitors, who may only be able to take in dogs for 3-4 months.   TRANSPORTERS: A person designated to take the dogs and cats for their  vetting. &amp;#40;Spay/Neuter etc&amp;#41; and sometimes to pick up and drop off at adoption events when the fosters are unable to bring them.   FUNDRAISERS: Anything to help bring in funds to our non profit Rescue. You will earn 10&amp;#37; of the money brought in to help the animals for each event!   VOLUNTEERS AT ADOPTION CENTER: Cleaning cat kennels &amp;#40;Inside help with cats and kittens weekday days &amp; nights&amp;#41;, cats laundry &amp;#40;pick up and drop off&amp;#41;,  play time with cats,feeding cats,Walking dogs, cleaning their kennels, watering  &amp; feeding, Quiet petting time and playing with them.   PHOTO POSTINGS: Cats &amp; kittens that are adoption ready at the Petsmart Center, take  photos of cats &amp; kittens and take information on them, post on 3 of our favorite sites online. This job is currently being structured/created, and will be opening up soon!  Let me know if any of these interest you at this time.

        "description": "<p>&amp;#126;&amp;#126;I&amp;#39;m about 6 years old Chihuahua mixed. I was hiding out behind some bushes for about a week with another girl dog. That is until someone took my friend and left me behind. I stayed there scared and lonely.&amp;nbsp; A lady picked me up and took me to a vet where they gave me all my shoots and chipped me.&amp;nbsp; That lady handed me off to my new foster home but she never told them that I&amp;#39;m pregnant. My foster home is great and they give me so much love but their landlord discovered me and is enforcing a no pets rule. My foster mom lied and said she was just pet-sitting. TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND BEING PREGNANT IS SO EXHAUSTING. I&amp;#39;m currently weight 17.8 lbs. although my foster parents are trying every possible way to help me and making sure I&amp;#39;m comfortable they can&amp;#39;t keep me for much longer.</p>  <p>I&amp;#39;m a really good girl, I promise! I&amp;#39;m not a barker. I love car rides and going on walks. I know how to shake your paw. I&amp;#39;m really good at receiving love and returning love right back at you. Enjoy kids and other animals not bother me. I&amp;#39;m also potty trained! I like to go outside to potty. Since I&amp;#39;m pregnant I lately just need to rest. I won&amp;#39;t get in your way and I don&amp;#39;t go through your stuff. I would really love to a steady home or a foster home that could help me with my unborn puppies. I&amp;#39;m a good girl and I know if I was giving a second shot at having a real home I would make you so happy. My foster mom tells me all the time that I&amp;#39;m just a lover and what a good girl I am. She also tells me that whomever gets me will be the luckiest person ever. I know she wishes it was her but then we would both be homeless and I don&amp;#39;t want to be homeless again. Please help me! Please my unborn puppies and I need a safe and loving place.</p>  <p>Contact my foster mom Griselda for more questions about me - <a href='mailto:Griselda.hair&amp;#64;gmail.com'>Griselda.hair&amp;#64;gmail.com</a></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7535384&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Imagine living the first 3 years of your life under the overpasses of Culver City bike path&amp;#63; Being born there, hot in the summers, cold in the winters, the noise, the smells and the constant fear of not knowing where your next meal would come from and how you would make it to tomorrow. This was little Romeo&amp;#39;s reality for THREE long years, until he was captured by Animal Control. Needless to say, he was not exactly the most cooperative pup, and quickly became a candidate for the dreaded needle. Fortunately, one of our Sachi Animal Rescue volunteer happened to be there that day. Whether Romeo knew this was the end of the road for him or not, our volunteer swears his eyes pleaded with her for help. She did not turn away, did not avert his gaze and decided against the advice of Animal Control to take him out. This turned out to be a more difficult task than anticipated, as Romeo had never been touched by humans before and was not about to let this happen. He was as feral as they come, growling, snarling and lunging. Yes, this was going to be a challenging endeavor for SAR. We faced it head on, determined to not let this dog down. Fast forward to today: Romeo is now a well adjusted boy, energetic and loving, who enjoys long hikes and loves to run and play with toys. As a Husky/German Shepherd mix, he seems to have a permanent smile on his face and his expression brightens when he recognizes a familiar face. He is so excited to see some of our volunteers that he will let out a long howl, followed by a quick bark to let them know where he is and that it is time for some much needed one on one cuddling. He has been a remarkable student on every levels. His social skills with both people and dogs are up to par with all our other orphans. From where he started we never expected such an amazing turn around in such a small amount of time. Romeo is once again a reminder for us all, of the incredible spirit dogs can exhibit if only given a chance, of the incredible determination they can show in overcoming the most dire circumstances and odds. Romeo is a winner in our book, and anyone lucky enough to welcome this magnificent boy into their lives would definitely be hitting the jackpot.</p>  <p>&amp;#91;BuBu was born in 2003 and about 45 lbs.&amp;#93;</p>  <p>If you&amp;#39;d like to meet Bubu, please contact <strong><font color='#F87A17'>Sachi Animal Rescue: &amp;#40;310&amp;#41; 455-1901 </font></strong>or <strong><a href='mailto:sachianimalrescue&amp;#64;gmail.com'>sachianimalrescue&amp;#64;gmail.com </a></strong></p>  <p><font color='#842DCE'>Note: This is a courtesy posting for our fellow rescuer, which means that even though this animal does not belong to our group, we are here to help those who need to find a home for their animals.

Orlando was tied outside a mobile home, on a short leash, every day for at least a year! Bought as a gift from a granddaughter to a woman who doesn't like dogs. Came in totally infested with fleas. Now grows happier every day. Loves to be talked to, sits on your lap, doesn't like his face kissed but we can live with that :&amp;#41;. Probably between 1-2 years old. Approximately 15 lbs. Not tiny for a Shih Tzu but certainly a small dog in great need of kind loving person &amp;#40;people&amp;#41; who know and love dogs and want to make a difference in the life of a poor little guy who never had a break.

But foster mom says I am perfect. I do not have the use of my back legs, but I have a cart that was special made for me that I love to fly around in.

Oh, and I also love to eat!<br /></span><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>Foster mom helps me go potty, and we do exercises with my back legs every day.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;sleep snuggled beside her all night long in the big bed, and I only snore a little.

        "description": "<p>Hello! My name is Fatboy, but my friends call me Bob. I am a 4 year old bachelor looking for a place to call my own. I&amp;#39;m not much of a partier. I prefer nights at the house, laying on the couch and watching chick flicks with my foster mom. However, I am up for going out, at times, for long walks with the human of my dreams. I also really enjoy the w <span class='text_exposed_hide'>...</span> <span class='text_exposed_show'>ater! Whether its splashing around and playing, or laying in the water to cool my heels, I am happiest to be playing in water. I will even settle for a water hose and a kiddie pool, cuz I&amp;#39;m just an easy going type of guy! Like any man, I&amp;#39;m not much for cuddling, but I will definitely give away kisses like they are going out of style! I&amp;#39;m very much into being around my human, so I&amp;#39;m not so keen on being confined to smaller places. I&amp;#39;m working on it though! I&amp;#39;m also working really hard at potty training and have even learned to use the potty bells! Although I get along with most other dogs, I prefer dogs my size or smaller. I can&amp;#39;t help it! I don&amp;#39;t need any competition! All in all, I&amp;#39;m a very sweet and gentle guy. And as you can probably tell, I&amp;#39;m pretty dang handsome, even with my wrinkles&amp;#40;I don&amp;#39;t believe in Botox&amp;#41;. I&amp;#39;m just looking for someone to call my own and a place to come home to!

A group of foster homes joining together to help dogs find forever homes where they can be part of the family. <br />WE ARE NOT A SHELTER. <br />Some of our dogs are rescues from puppy mills who have had to endure having multiple litters of pups and deplorable living conditions. Some dogs are taken from kill shelters to prevent euthanasia and give them a second chance or&amp;nbsp;taken in on owner relinquishments or owner abuse cases. ALL pets are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and recieve any other medical needs.&amp;nbsp;<br />We require a &amp;nbsp;adoption&amp;nbsp;donation. &amp;nbsp;Fees may vary. Normally fees run &amp;#36;350-450 with puppies being higher. &amp;nbsp;This is to cover any medical fees, transporting to us and other expenses incurred for these dogs and future care for the next one. Some of the animals that come to us are sometimes costly with vet bills due to poor conditions they were kept in. Our goal is to place these animals as healthy and happy companions.</span><br /><span style='font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #6209ad; font-size: 18pt;'>SERIOUS INQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS GO TO OUR HOME WEBSITE: </span>theydeservebetterdogrescue.org</span></p><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;1888371&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Dozer can sit, play fetch, and he gets what we like to call the 'zoomies' when he gets super excited. He loves to play tug of war, and he can play for hours if you let him. He DOES NOT like to be left alone for long periods of time. He needs to have a fence 10 ft, or taller. He is a jumper and a runner. He loves going for walks, and is gonna need more leash training. He doesn't like other dogs or cats and would probably do best in a home with kids 12&amp;#43;. He is scared of fireworks and thunder. He likes the water but doesn't enjoy baths. He likes to get snuggles and kisses before bed and his favorite spot to sleep is at your feet. He really is a good dog that will bring you a lot of happiness. He just needs to go to the right home. He LOVES cheese. He loves toys too, but the rope toys he'll eat. He likes to tear apart the plush doggy toys and burry the squeaker. He used to burry all his squeaks in my couch, so when you would sit down my couch would squeak. He has so much love to give. He had parvo as a baby, but is doing great now. He is a good boy and he needs loving patient people around him. Please consider adding Dozer to your family!</p> <p>Dozer is a participant in the DFWRM Guest Dog Program, so his ongoing care and custody are provided by his foster, not by DFWRM.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6757400&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He is fully housetrained and knows several commands, such as sit, stay, speak, shake, off, lay down, back, and out. He loves to play tug of war, to chase and retrieve balls and more, and would do really well in a family with older children to help him expend that energy!</p> <p>Zeus can get very excited when someone first enters the home, and will sometime jump up on them, but he calms down after a few minutes. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a bit excitable, and is a big, strong boy, he can be a bit overwhelming to little children or toddlers!

        "description": "<p>Darcy is a sweet dog whose breed is anyones guess. She showed up at someones house as a stray and it took 4 days to catch her. She is a very sweet dog and is ok with other dogs but would probably be best as the only dog.</p>  <p>Darcy is a digger and loves to dig holes in the yard. She does not attempt to climb or dig under the fence. She is housebroken and crate trained. She will bark when someone comes around.</p>  <p>Darcy has been spayed and is up to date on vaccines. Unfortunately she was found to be heartworm positive and will start her heartworm treatment June 21. She will need to be confined for a month afterwards so she will not be available for adoption until the end of July. You are welcome to meet her prior to that.</p>  <p>Darcy has been microchipped.</p>  <p>6/28 Darcy has had her first heartworm treatment and is doing well with it. She goes back in July for her second treatment.</p>  <p>9/28 Darcy has finished heartworm treatment and is now HW negative. She is seeking her forever home.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7063770&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

If there is a way this can be corrected, he would be a great dog. This generally happens when there is more than one person in his presence.

That's the best word to describe Jack. He always seems happy! Jack is a smart boy, and he loves to retrieve. He hasn't been leash trained, but he'll go along with the whole idea, and does not pull like crazy, just because there's a person at the other end of the leash. He absolutely loves being with people and is good with kids. Jack gets along well with other dogs, but people are more his type! Jack would benefit from some basic obedience skills training because he's a wonderful boy who is too smart to be left untrained. &amp;nbsp;Adopt &amp;#40;or foster&amp;#41; Jack and learn what a joy it is to work with a smart dog who is focused and has a real desire to make you proud of him!</span></p> <p>Jack's estimated DOB is October 2008 and he weighs approximately 45 lbs.</p> <p>&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;This beautiful dog is currently in the shelter in Tennessee but has received full vet care and we will provide FREE volunteer transport to a foster or forever home&amp;hellip;please don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop you from adopting! &amp;nbsp; We are accepting applications to&amp;nbsp;<a title='ADOPTION APPLICATION' href='http://lazulinedream.com/seadogrescue/adoption/adoption-application/'>ADOPT</a>&amp;nbsp;OR&amp;nbsp;<a title='FOSTER APPLICATION' href='http://lazulinedream.com/seadogrescue/foster/foster-application/'>FOSTER</a>&amp;nbsp;each of the Tennessee dogs listed so they can get out of the shelter.</p> <hr /> <p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;Sea Dog Rescue is a foster home based rescue - we do not have a shelter or kennel facility nor do we have regular hours when our companions can be seen.

She is an American Pit mix who loves to play fetch, loves to snuggle, is friendly and great on walks. She was rescued by some nice folks in Connecticut who are looking for the family that will love her forever. They will be rewarded with a great dog in return. Veda is fantastic with kids and adults  <span class='text_exposed_show'>alike. The only hiccup is that she&amp;#39;s not great with small dogs or cats, so she&amp;#39;s just better off in a single-dog home.. She&amp;#39;s 4 years old, spayed, up to date on her shots, and healthy.<br /> <br /> This is a COURTESY POST &amp;#40;i.e., this is not a Badass dog&amp;#41;, so please contact Veda&amp;#39;s private rescuers directly at adoptveda&amp;#64;gmail.com if you are interested!</span> </span> </span> </p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7659783&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

The shelter sent him to a private vet for treatment of several bite wounds. When we saw him he was in a lot of pain and scared - so we got him out of the shelter so that he could heal both physically and emotionally. He has been with us several months and is all healed and needs a home.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: CeeDee is a very sweet and needy little boy... but he takes a little time to get to know people. He's not a fan of strangers, so he will need slow introduction to new people. Once he knows you, he will want to be next to you all of the time. He does not like to be alone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: CeeDee seems to be housebroken but will need some training. He walks great on leash but does not potty well on leash.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp; CeeDee would do best in an adult-only home that doesn't leave him home alone too much... He needs a yard or outdoor space where he can potty off-leash. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: CeeDee does well with some dogs and seems to be great with cats - but he is not recommended for children. &amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. There will be no residual medical concerns once his wounds heal - he will be back to 100&amp;#37;. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit our website:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit us on Facebook:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome' target='_blank'>http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Make a donation to help us continue to save lives:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</a></span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5610642&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Blazer comes to us from a local animal shelter after being an unfortunate victim of a hoarding case here in Jacksonville.&amp;nbsp; Despite the neglect of attention and care, Blazer is in pretty good shape for his age. Blazer has had a full work up at our vet. His bloodwork and exam came back with excellent results for his age.&amp;nbsp; He does have some arthrtis in his back but thats to be expected at his age. Blazer also has a slight cherry eye but it does not need to removed and does not cause him any issues.&amp;nbsp; <br /><br />Blazer would do best with a retired couple or person.&amp;nbsp; Although Blazer loves to take walks and run around in the yard, he really likes to live a laid back life in the house.&amp;nbsp; Lots of lap, bed and couch time.&amp;nbsp; Blazer is highly trainable and food motivated.&amp;nbsp; Because of Blazers's age and arthritis in his back, he would prefer without children.&amp;nbsp; Blazer gets along with dogs who are as laid back as he is.&amp;nbsp; He likes his space too so a only dog home would suit him fine as well.&amp;nbsp; <br /><br />Blazer is up to date on all vaccines.<br /><br />Blazer is crate and house trained. <br /><br />Blazer is neutered. <br /><br />Blazer is micro chipped.&amp;nbsp;<img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7666825&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I lived on my own for a long time, and several people tried to catch me. Most of them weren't successful, but one young lady managed to snare me. She took me to the vet, and I was vaccinated &amp;#40;ouch!&amp;#41; neutered &amp;#40;whose idea was that&amp;#63;&amp;#41;, and loved &amp;#40;YES!&amp;#41;. I stayed at the clinic from October until December because there was no place else for me to go. I was a bit shy when I first arrived there, but the vet techs played with me when they could. Now I have many, many friends, both two-legged and four. I am great with kids too! I'm no longer at all frightened of people, and I can't wait to belong with someone special. As a bonus, I enjoy walking and am good on a leash. &amp;nbsp;I am a calm and happy boy! I know that someone is going to say, 'That's the boy for me!' very soon, and I'll be packing my toys and heading out. Today could be that day!</span></p> <p>&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;This beautiful dog is currently in the shelter in Tennessee but has received full vet care and we will provide FREE volunteer transport to a foster or forever home&amp;hellip;please don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop you from adopting! &amp;nbsp; We are accepting applications to&amp;nbsp;<a title='ADOPTION APPLICATION' href='http://lazulinedream.com/seadogrescue/adoption/adoption-application/'>ADOPT</a>&amp;nbsp;OR&amp;nbsp;<a title='FOSTER APPLICATION' href='http://lazulinedream.com/seadogrescue/foster/foster-application/'>FOSTER</a>&amp;nbsp;each of the Tennessee dogs listed so they can get out of the shelter.</p> <hr /> <p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;Sea Dog Rescue is a foster home based rescue - we do not have a shelter or kennel facility nor do we have regular hours when our companions can be seen.

On the plus side...House trained, perfect size, great house manners, walks well on a leash and has good recall off leash. Loyal, affectionate and protective, this is a great dog for the RIGHT home! And she loves water..and the mud it makes too! On the minus side she is not good with new dogs but will make up with a proper introduction and time, and she needs an experienced adult only home where she isn't allowed to run the show. She will need someone who is willing to visit her several times to get to know her prior to adoption. Happy once she bonds with you, and active, she always appears to be smiling but she is getting sad at the shelter and NEEDS her own home. One that will stick by her thru thick and thin.

Thankfully the witness happens to be a rescuer.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Jacqueline is SUPER affectionate and sweet. She is puppy playful, but only in spurts... otherwise she's a pretty lazy girl &amp;#40;which is a Great Dane trait&amp;#41;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Jacqueline will need leash training and at least a basic obedience course. She is already doing FANTASTIC with crate training and housebreaking. She is extremely smart.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp; Jacqueline would do best in a home with another large dog to be her guide and with a family that will spend lots of time loving her, playing with her, and training her. She requires a yard. Because she only has one eye, she is not a dog that can go off-leash hiking and must be kept on leash out in public at all times. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Jacqueline is fantastic with big dogs and she would be wondeful with children. At her foster home she does chase the cats - but only to play - and they are teaching her a few lessons &amp;#40;so she would be okay with cats that are used to dogs - but not with cats that would be afraid of her&amp;#41;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. Jacqueline was born without one of her eyes - it was a birth defect. We will be having the eye socket permanently sewed shut to keep it from getting infected.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit our website:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit us on Facebook:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome' target='_blank'>http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Make a donation to help us continue to save lives:&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</a></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5720351&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

But I warm up after a few minutes, and I'm finding out they don't want to hurt me, just pet me. These kind people are feeding me well and taking care of me, and I really like them. And we're having lots of fun. I've even gained a few&amp;nbsp;pounds since I've been here! I love to run and play in the yard. You should see how fast I can run after a ball! I need someone who will love me and show me what the good life is all about. Will you&amp;#63; Check out my video below - Fast Freddie needs a best friend on the other end of this leash... 10/20/14</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>&amp;nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>To apply online or to see other available basset hounds, go to&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.cbhr.com/'>www.cbhr.com</a>.</span></p><br /><br /><object width=&amp;#34;425&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;350&amp;#34;><param name=&amp;#34;movie&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/v/o4UjnsWHZxI&amp;#34;></param><param name=&amp;#34;wmode&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34;></param><embed src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/v/o4UjnsWHZxI&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&amp;#34; wmode=&amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;425&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;350&amp;#34;></embed></object><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5864878&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I am an outgoing, affectionate 3.5 year old boxer mix that wants to find my forever home. I am a sweet girl that enjoys playing and running as well as lounging and being a snuggle-bug. I will always happily accept belly rubs &amp;#40;my favorite!&amp;#41;, walks, and treat toys.&amp;nbsp;<br /> <br /> I was originally adopted when I was less than a year old; however, I got separated and have not been able to be reunited as the contact information had a disconnected number. I am currently a guest with a family that found me on August 2nd &amp;#40;that's in Tarrant County, Fort Worth 76107&amp;#41; and temporally took me in. They would keep me, but they already have a full house.<br /> <br /> It would be great if I could be your one and only four-legged child. One look in my eyes will tell you that I will love you forever. I REALLY want to be the only pet in the home.</p> <p>Thanks for considering adopting me,<br /> Sylvia</p> <p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in adding a sweet, affectionate young girl like Sylvia to your family, &amp;#40;one who can even right her own bio!!&amp;#41; please start at <a href='http://www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt'>www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt</a> to complete and submit the adoption application found there.&amp;nbsp; Her foster will contact you promptly to tell you more about her, and to arrange a meeting for you!</p> <p>'This handsome dog is a participant in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so their ongoing care and custody are provided by their foster, not by DFWRM.'</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7550830&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I found her on a very cold day, a few weeks before she gave birth to 10 pups, and the minute she stopped breastfeeding them she breastfed 10 more for a lab that &amp;nbsp;passed away suddenly. She is a very loving and nurturing dog waiting for someone to mother her. &amp;nbsp;Her 2 favorite things to do are play with her brothers and sisters and to be loved on by anyone willing to love on her.

She is healing nicely and so far has had no aftereffects from the spaying. It takes Maya a little time to get used to new people. She is a sweet affectionate dog that needs to be an only dog because she doesn't want to share with anyone. Definately no cats. As long as you get her on a schedule she is trained to go outside. She is currently in a fenced in yard and loves the freedom of the back yard. Sometimes I have to sit on the floor and let her come to me in order to leash her to get her outside. It took her a few months to acclimate herself to the household.<br /><br />A friend of mine took some photographs of Maya and Yankee today. I just received this link and hope that people can get to it:<br /><a href='https://www.facebook.com/media/set/&amp;#63;set=a.335601086574446.1073741841.190653607735862&amp;amp;type=1'>https://www.facebook.com/media/set/&amp;#63;set=a.335601086574446.1073741841.190653607735862&amp;amp;type=1</a><br /><br />Enjoy the photos.<br /><br /></p><br /><br /><h2>Additional Information</h2> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Please note that if you applied or are planning to apply to adopt a dog from us, your initial contact will more than likely be via your email address.&amp;nbsp; Please make sure that the email address you send to us is correct, and please make sure that your email will allow messages from us!&amp;nbsp; You will get an email from one of our volunteers at justatouchrescue.com, or from justatouchrescue&amp;#64;yahoo.com.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>You must have a verifiable veterinary reference to adopt our dogs.&amp;nbsp; Please visit our </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/info/adoption'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>Adoption Process</span></span></a><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'> </span>page for more information.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Remember, the application must be filled out completely - incomplete applications can not be processed.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>We do not have a facility that you can visit.&amp;nbsp; Our dogs are all fostered in private homes.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Please go to </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>http://www.justatouchrescue.com/</span></span></a>&amp;nbsp;<span style='font-size: 10pt;'>for more information and to fill out our </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/forms/'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>on line application</span></span></a><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>.</span></p><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5545735&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I LOVE THIS DOG! Great personality, total social butterfly, lovely attitude, lovely dog, and very pretty other than the horrible home chop-job on her ears :&amp;#40; Kinsey is a 3-4y, chocolate tri-color Pitbull. She is 45-ish lbs, crate-trained, dog/cat/kid social. GREAT DOG. She is just a lovey, squishy, sweet and affectionate love bug. She'll be a great choice for just about anyone .<br />Only negative - can climb a 4' fence if left unattended. She prefers to be with her people, not outside in a yard all alone.<br /><br />If you are interested in adopting, the adoption donation is &amp;#36;100 and covers full vetting &amp;#40;vaccinations, dewormings, spay/neuter, heartworm testing, etc&amp;#41; prior to adoption.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><br />E-mail LaurensZoo.application&amp;#64;yahoo.com for more info!<br /><br />&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;Please check your Spam Folder for our reply. We send out a lot of e-mails and have recently been getting complaints about not promptly responding to inquiries. Several servers filter our responses as Spam&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;<br /><br />Availability Inquiries: If the dog is still posted then he/she is available. We may have already accepted applications but have not chosen one yet. Please send yours if you'd like to be considered. A 'pending' status means that the pet is spoken for, but the adoption has yet to be finalized. This pet may become available again if the adoption is not completed within a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Location: We do not have a physical location where all of our dogs are housed nor do we have 'business hours'. We are made up of a network of private foster homes and sometimes use boarding. Once we have received your application, we can provide you with details and arrange a 'meet and greet' when possible. We require an application before any meetings will be arranged. <br /><br />Cats/Kids and Dogs: If we don't specifically mention cats/kids in the bio then we don't know exactly how a particular dog will react to them. If we suspect there will be aggression then we will say no to cats/kids. However, every dog needs to be introduced correctly to a house with cats or kids in it. Each dog and each cat/kid will have different chemistry together so there is no way to tell how they will act until the dog is in the home. Puppies less than one year of age can always go to a home with cats or kids, but they too need to learn. With a little effort, dogs and cats/kids can live together...but don't forget that dogs will be dogs so sometimes you will need to step in.<br /><br />Out-of-state Adoptions: We will consider adopting to all states, but transport options are limited to some areas. Adopters are responsible for all additional fees associated with transporting a pet out-of-state. </span></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7041553&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Harlie suffered back trauma and was paralyzed. Thanks to her first rescuer, she now can walk! Harlie can potty on her own, but needs to go out frequently because it's sometimes hard for her to hold it when her bladder gets full. She will bark to let you know she needs to go outside. Harlie is very conscious of being touched on her back end, and if startled, will react with growling and mouthing. Harlies only special need is a family that will love her and understand her. She should not be around young children especially toddlers, but older respectful kids who will understand her sensitivity would be great.</p> </div> <div><span>&amp;nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style='font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;'><span>&amp;nbsp;</span></span></div><br /><br /><h2>Additional Information</h2> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Please note that if you applied or are planning to apply to adopt a dog from us, your initial contact will more than likely be via your email address.&amp;nbsp; Please make sure that the email address you send to us is correct, and please make sure that your email will allow messages from us!&amp;nbsp; You will get an email from one of our volunteers at justatouchrescue.com, or from justatouchrescue&amp;#64;yahoo.com.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>You must have a verifiable veterinary reference to adopt our dogs.&amp;nbsp; Please visit our </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/info/adoption'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>Adoption Process</span></span></a><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'> </span>page for more information.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Remember, the application must be filled out completely - incomplete applications can not be processed.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>We do not have a facility that you can visit.&amp;nbsp; Our dogs are all fostered in private homes.</span></p> <p><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>Please go to </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>http://www.justatouchrescue.com/</span></span></a>&amp;nbsp;<span style='font-size: 10pt;'>for more information and to fill out our </span><a href='http://www.justatouchrescue.com/forms/'><span style='font-size: 10pt;'><span style='color: #0000ff;'>on line application</span></span></a><span style='font-size: 10pt;'>.</span></p><br /><br /><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5933068&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

They said she mainly stayed outdoors because they didn't want her fur in the house. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Violet Rose is cautious of new people, and needs some good TLC. She has learned to trust us within a short amount of time and she has been very sweet and loving since. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Violet Rose will need some general training tips again since she is not used to a loving environment. &amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST: &amp;nbsp;Violet Rose would do best in a calm home with someone who can help her overcome some of her fears. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Violet Rose is great with other dogs, and has not been around cats. We would not recommend her for small children because of her history &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD: All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application.

Big people, little people, all people!</p> <p>She will go with you anywhere, by foot or by wheels, or lay beside you for eternity. She would very much enjoy being the only doggie you love, so she can have all the hugs and rubs, but she loves some dogs &amp;#40;such as her little 12 pound running / sleeping / playing buddy! &amp;nbsp;So having the right four legged friend could be great as well!&amp;nbsp;</p> <p>Spica is now seven and a half years old &amp;#40;Nov 2014&amp;#41;, weighs close to 50 pounds, thinks a good rawhide is a great chew, and is what we call an 'easy keeper'.

I was wandering the streets alone, scared and hungry when I was hit by an SUV.</p> <p>A very kind lady happened to be driving by on her way to work and saw me laying under a car and she thought that I was dead. The lady took interest in finding out what had become of me, whether I survived or not and where I ended up. After calling many places she finally tracked me down at animal services.</p> <p>Miraculously I survived being hit by the SUV with only a few minor abrasions. However, my days were numbered at animal services as I was put on their list to be euthanized so she tried to find a place for me to go where I would be safe. She found a loving foster home and I made it out of there alive.</p> <p>I am one of the lucky ones. I currently live with several dogs at my foster&amp;nbsp;home and I get along with all dogs very well. I am about 3 yrs old, still very much a puppy and I love to play all the time. I also have some puppy behaviors, but eventually I'll outgrow them. I love getting lots of attention from my foster parents and I hope to find a forever home where I will get tons of love and attention every day. I am looking for a family who understands puppy behaviors and who will love and cherish me forever, I love to give kisses and promise to snuggle with you. I am up to date on my shots, spayed, micro chipped&amp;nbsp;and heart worm &amp;amp; fecal&amp;nbsp;negative. If you would like to learn more about me, please call my foster parents at &amp;#40;813&amp;#41; 966-5830.</p> <p>Adoption Donation: &amp;#36;150</p> <p><strong>A healthy pet is a happy pet!

        "description": "Brooke is a darling dog who loves to be held, and is an all around sweetheart.  Walks well on the leash - no pulling. Easy going.Gets along with other dogs.. Would be a good dog for someone looking for a little being to keep them company. Best in an adult home &amp;#40;or with older children&amp;#41; as the little ones can sometimes overwhelm her.  Note from Brooke's dog buddy after a visit to her home:  'That day at my home, she sat next to me on the couch, leaning against my side, with her head turned up, resting against me, eyes closed.  She looked so happy and content to just sit there with someone.  She is so loving and affectionate and undemanding.  She would be a wonderful companion.'

        "description": "On the evening of October 30th, two teenage boys were beating a pit bull mix with wooden bats as she lay unable to move from numerous broken bones and injuries. Unable to defend herself or run to safety, the torture only stopped when a Good Samaritan chased the abusers away and brought Maggie to a neighbor for help. The Animal Assistance League of Orange County rushed Maggie to Advanced Critical Care Veterinary hospital where Maggie was found to have multiple pelvic fractures, two fractured ribs numerous lacerations and possible leg nerve damage. Maggie is still healing from these traumatic injuries, but has regained her love of life. She is a very loving and trusting dog, and greets everyone with a wiggle and a grin. Feeling a little better each day, she is starting to show a more goofy and playful side. Maggie is such a resiliant and happy dog, and deserves to find a safe loving home where she will never have to hurt again. She will need to be the only pet, and will undoubtedly return all the love and devotion she recieves completely.

        "description": "<p>DOB: November 2013 &amp;#124;&amp;#124; BREED/COLORING: Chihuahua Mix/ Cream Coloring &amp;#124;&amp;#124; SIZE: Chuck is about 6lbs and is full grown &amp;#124;&amp;#124; HISTORY: Chuck was found running scared in an industrial area in the San Fernando Valley. We believe Chuck was originally thrown out on the streets to fend for himself by his previous owner. &amp;#124;&amp;#124;PERSONALITY: Chuck seems shy at first but once he is comfortable he is a waggy kissy little guy. He wants to be a lap dog completely if he can. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; TRAINING: Chuck has not had much in the ways of training, so he will require some patience. &amp;#124;&amp;#124;WOULD DO BEST: Chuck would do best in almost any type of home. &amp;#124;&amp;#124;CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Chuck is good with cats &amp;amp; dogs. We do not recommend chuck in a home with small children unless there is already a small dog there because he is shy and might shy away from them. <br /> &amp;#124;&amp;#124;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. <br />&amp;#124;&amp;#124;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being<br />fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we<br />will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;#124;&amp;#124;<br /> Visit our website: http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/ &amp;#124;&amp;#124;<br /> Visit us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome &amp;#124;&amp;#124;<br /> Make a donation to help us continue to save lives: http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;7968285&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

We don't know what her history was prior to that, but clearly she deserves better than what she's had. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY:&amp;nbsp;Bonnie is a very sweet girl - full of wags and kisses. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING:&amp;nbsp;We are not sure if Bonnie is housebroken or not because she is currently in a rescue kennel. She will definitely need a home willing to work with her on leash and on housebreaking. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp;Bonnie needs a yard and a home where her family will commit to her forever. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;CATS/DOGS/KIDS:&amp;nbsp;Bonnie seems to be okay with other male, calm dogs. She is not recommended for homes with cats or small dogs. she would do great with kids over five years of age. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area.

        "description": "<p>DOB: July 2007;&amp;nbsp;Breed/Coloring: Chihuahua mix, red</p> <p>Size: Honey weighs about 15lbs and is full grown</p> <p>History: Honey was thrown over the fence at a rescue kennel one night by her idiot owners.</p> <p>Personality: Honey is shy in new situations but is very people-oriented and comes around quickly. She is a very calm and quiet girl.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Training: Honey has been at a kennel so she will need some work on housebreaking. She is shy and spools easily on leash, so socialization will be important.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Would Do Best: Honey would do best in a quiet home and could either be with another calm dog or by herself. She would prefer not to be left alone more than 5 hours a day and really would like at least a small outdoor area &amp;#40;no balconies&amp;#41;.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Vet Record : Currently vaccinated, spayed and microchipped.</p> <p>Cats, Dogs and Kids: Honey is hood with other dogs although she would rather interract with humans. She ignores cats. She could be with older children.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Availability:&amp;nbsp; Honey is available for adoption now. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application.

        "description": "<p>DOB:&amp;nbsp; December 2008;&amp;nbsp; Breed/Coloring:&amp;nbsp; Terrier Mix</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Size:&amp;nbsp; Lizzie weighs about 17lbs and is full grown</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;History:&amp;nbsp; I was found wandering the streets of Pacoima about 6 months ago - emaciated and sad.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Personality:&amp;nbsp; Lizzie is very shy and tends to get picked on by other dogs. She is sweet and snuggly with people, but nervous.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Training:&amp;nbsp; Lizzie has been in a kennel environment so she will need work on her housebreaking. We recommend crate training. She is very shy on leash and could use some confidence building.</p> <p>Would Do Best:&amp;nbsp; Lizzie would do best in a quiet, adult-only home with at least a small yard. She would like the company of another dog - one that won't pick on her.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Vet Record :&amp;nbsp; All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped upon adoption.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Cats, Dogs and Kids:&amp;nbsp; Lizzie is great with cats and dogs her size of smaller - especially boy dogs. She is not recommended for homes with children due to her timidness.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;Availability:&amp;nbsp; This dog is available for adoption now. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;3568966&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Fortunately, he let the volunteers know he was there by barking. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Rocky is a super duper sweet little guy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Rockee walks okay on leash. We do not know if he is housebroken because he is at a kennel, but he does seem to do well with crate training on the weekends. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST: Rocky would like someone to love him as much as possible - someone who is home a lot. He could be with another dog or cat - or not. He's a pretty easy going boy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Rockee is great with other dogs and cats and would probably be great with kids. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area.

He was malnourished at 48 pounds and suffering from a horrific case of demodectic mange that had advanced to the point where it ruptured his hair follicles, the year-and-a-half old Pit mix also suffered from a bacterial skin infection secondary to the mange that involved three different types of bacteria. Joey has recovered from his ailments and is ready for his forever home. Joey is young and very energetic. He would do best in a home with bully breed experience. He has been socialized with the rest of the pack in foster care but can be pushy at times &amp;ndash; Joey likes being the center of attention.

        "description": "Joey was found tied up to a bench at a beach in Far Rockaway on a cold February morning by NYPD.  Joey was the picture of the shameful result of neglect and abuse.  He was malnourished at 48 pounds and suffering from a horrific case of demodectic mange that had advanced to the point where it ruptured his hair follicles, the year-and-a-half old Pit mix also suffered from a bacterial skin infection secondary to the mange that involved three different types of bacteria.  Joey has recovered from his ailments and is ready for his forever home.  Joey is young and very energetic.  He would do best in a home with bully breed experience.  He has been socialized with the rest of the pack in foster care but can be pushy at times. Joey likes being the center of attention.  If you are interested more information about Joey or would like to meet him please email me at ruthann&amp;#64;tailsofloverescue.org or &amp;#40;646&amp;#41;436-3625.

        "description": "<p>My name is <strong>CAPONE</strong> &amp;amp; I'm a handsome&amp;nbsp;<strong>PUREBRED UKC</strong> registered 5 y M Blue/White American Staffordshire Terrier. Actually I'm an <strong>'American Bully'</strong> I'm a big blue <strong>'sexy beast'</strong> and am 102 lbs of<strong> PURE MUSHMELLOW</strong>. Look at my sweet big mushface!! I was surrendered by my owner due to housing issues but he spoiled me rotten and let me have run of the &amp;nbsp;house and sleep on the couch and bed. Still he raised me well, because I have no separation anxiety, am housebroken, walk well on the leash and am not a barker. I may look mean but I'm just a<strong> BIG BABY, a GENTLE GIANT</strong> and have a <strong>very sweet mellow low key</strong>&amp;nbsp;temperament and just want to be your best bud. Since I was an only dog, I wasn't socialized with lots of dogs but I seem to be ok with calm dogs, big or small however I do love puppies! I'm great with kids but I don't know about cats. They freak me out a bit. I think I could be trained with them but best if I don't go to a home w/ cats. I'm very easy going and not a hyper dog. I need to go to a home with someone who knows, understands and appreciates my breed. Please come and meet/adopt me today!!

        "description": "<p>I'm <strong>ROXY</strong> I'm a beautiful 4 yr F Brindle/White Amstaff/Boxer X. I am approx<strong> 55 lbs of PURE BROWN SUGAR</strong>. I was rescued in the nick of time from a high kill shelter in NY as a puppy &amp;amp; I found a home pretty quickly but due to a moving situation, my adopters couldn't keep me. &amp;nbsp;I'm missing toes on my left front paw - not sure if I was born with this handicap or it was due to an accident or abuse - &amp;nbsp;but as a result, I tend to walk with a little limp. It makes me a little insecure, but it doesn't hinder my amazing fetching abilities. <strong>I love to run and chase the ball and can play fetch all day!</strong> I am good with most dogs as long as they are calm, balanced i.e submissive and ones that don't care about toys since I like to hoard/protect them. I like to chase cats a bit too much and small kids have too much energy for me and make me nervous. I'm a bit guarded with strangers at first but as soon as I warm up to them, I'm their BFF forever esp if they have a ball! I'm looking for a quiet adult only home with someone who is medium active and knows my breed and will give me the support and confidence I need and play fetch with me everyday! A big fenced in yard would be great too! Please come meet/adopt me today!</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6687102&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Estimated date of birth: 9/17/00<br />Current weight: approx. 50 lbs &amp;#40;full grown&amp;#41;<br /><br />Sissy is a friendly, outgoing girl who's looking for a family to love her forever. She adores squeaky toys and playing fetch. She's crate trained, housebroken, and working on basic commands. Sissy needs lots of&amp;nbsp;exercise but does not like to be left outside&amp;nbsp;unattended for too long. She'd love to have some school aged kids &amp;#40;or anyone with a lot of energy&amp;#41;&amp;nbsp;to play with. Sissy can be a bit pushy with other dogs so she'll do best as an only dog or with a dog who doesn't mind if Sissy is in charge. She gets overstimulated at adoption events so if you meet her there, be sure to talk to her foster about what she's &amp;#42;really&amp;#42; like at home. If you're looking for a dog to keep you company on walks/runs/hikes, weekend campouts/trips to the beach, or whatever comes up in your active lifestyle, Sissy can't wait to meet you.<br /><br />&amp;#36;125 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, rabies and other vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, and heartworm and flea preventatives while the dog is in our care.<br /><br />Like us on Facebook - search Mutts &amp;amp; Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.<img src='http://www.&amp;#63;3323956&amp;amp;a=9607&amp;amp;h=' alt='' width='0' height='0' /></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5689485&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

When I go to my new home, I will need to continue to work with trainer so I can become the best canine citizen there is! I ride very well in the car and I am currently potty trained. I know how to listen to my foster mama and will only chew on appropriate toys. I walk very well on leash, and I also know many commands! I know how to &amp;quot;sit,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wait,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;down,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;leave it,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;stay&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;easy.&amp;quot; I also know how to &amp;quot;shake&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;roll over&amp;quot; &amp;#40;both ways!&amp;#41; I get along very well with older children and can respect younger children, but I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t live with them since I might accidentally knock them over with my puppy energy and enthusiasm.</span> </span> </h1>  <div> <span><font color='#000000' face='Arial'> <span style='line-height: 20.25px; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;'>I am spayed, up to date on shots and rabies, and microchipped.</span> </font></span> </div>  <h1 dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.35; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;'> <span> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;255, 0, 0&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>If you are interested in adopting me, please contact my foster mama, Heather, at&amp;nbsp; </span> </span> <a href='mailto:obeachgirl&amp;#64;yahoo.com' target='_blank'><em>obeachgirl&amp;#64;yahoo.com</em></a></h1>  <h1 dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;'> <span> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;148, 138, 84&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;'>ZULI&amp;rsquo;S VIDEO:</span> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;20, 24, 35&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> </span> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;84, 141, 212&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;'><a href='http://l.facebook.com/l.php&amp;#63;u=http&amp;#37;3A&amp;#37;2F&amp;#37;2Fyoutu.be&amp;#37;2FTG8v_y7MYpQ&amp;amp;h=1AQECbnhD&amp;amp;enc=AZN6fKqpQ5B3fQkgnYtlnQflXTKBMeO_bJQrz_jgPrGqo2VRnJPBwRBQheAcYN5qgrdfCnZEq6aF7w6fII8uRF9zFoBf_hvp7uhfCB4rBEKDizhFQHmslYmBqePSUdl3GNIDWivU3ZEHpjsMonq0t9_E&amp;amp;s=1' style='text-decoration: none;' target='_blank'>http://youtu.be/TG8v_y7MYpQ</a></span> </span> </h1>  <h1 dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;'> <span> <span style='font-weight: normal;'> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;148, 138, 84&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;'>MORE PHOTOS OF ZULI:</span> <span style='color: rgb&amp;#40;0, 0, 0&amp;#41;; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;'> </span> <a href='http://on.fb.me/1smmDe6' style='text-decoration: none;' target='_blank'> <span style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;'>http://on.fb.me/1smmDe6</span> </a></span> </span> </h1><br /><br /><object width=&amp;#34;425&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;350&amp;#34;><param name=&amp;#34;movie&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/v/TG8v_y7MYpQ&amp;#34;></param><param name=&amp;#34;wmode&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34;></param><embed src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/v/TG8v_y7MYpQ&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&amp;#34; wmode=&amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;425&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;350&amp;#34;></embed></object><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8014038&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

For further information, please click on the Seniors 4 Seniors button on the left of this page.</p>  <p>Hello there! My name is Molly and I am looking for my soul mate :-&amp;#41; I am seven years old and a huge love muffin! My mom was a pretty and petite black and white Staffie mix who had the best personality ever! She was adopted to a wonderful family with children. I was actually adopted once, but my family didn&amp;#39;t take me out very often, so i thought I was doing my job when I would growl at people who came over. I didn&amp;#39;t know who the strangers were who came over so I just thought I was protecting my family :-&amp;#40; Unfortunately my family didn&amp;#39;t care about me anymore, so returned me to the rescue. I know that not many people inquire about me because of my breed, but I promise you...I am a young lady just yearning to love again.</p>  <p>My friend who runs the rescue just loves me :-&amp;#41; She says I am such a sweetie and gives me kisses all the time! I love when she takes me for rides...I just jump right in the front seat of her truck and lie on the seat next to her as she drives. I never try to sit on her lap while she is driving because I know that isn&amp;#39;t safe...I just lay down on my pretty pink blanket and enjoy the ride.</p>  <p>When I am out on walks or hanging out on a leash, I love when people or kids pet me! I will hang out and soak up all the attention I can get. When I am home I do like to protect my people/person, so I need to politely ask that whomever adopts me has the type of home that doesn&amp;#39;t get many visitors. I give you my word that I will never let anyone into our yard and will protect and keep you safe!!! Then, if you have people come over to visit, just put me in a crate or out in the back yard. I will keep myself entertained by throwing my toys around and catching them :-&amp;#41;</p>  <p>I have already been spayed, microchipped, and am current on my shots. My adoption fee is &amp;#36;100.</p>  <p>If interested in this pet, please fill out a questionnaire on the website below. Thanks!</p>  <h4><strong> <span style='color: #ff0000;'>FOSTER HOMES NEEDED!

I love to be comfy, loved and pampered. I am great with big people, but I'm a little too hyper for kids. I'm really not fond of cats. I don't understand them at all, and want to chase them, so a home without them would be great! I also do not like to share with other dogs. I like to have my people and toys all to myself. I have a lot of energy and am very active. I would love a family who can help me keep my energy and enthusiasm under control. I&amp;nbsp;love taking long walks and jogging as well.&amp;nbsp;I enjoy the beach and public outings. I have great manners at home, and am overall a whole lot of fun. Give me a chance to show you all the fun and love I have to offer! I'm up to date on shots, crate trained, heartworm negative, spayed and on heartworm preventative. I'm ready for my permanent family and I hope they are out there somewhere and ready for me too!<br /><br />Requirements for Piper's adption:<br />Must have a pet free home, must own your own home, &amp;amp; must have a fully fenced in yard.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;5960174&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He had an old injury to his hip and knee which requred his right rear leg to be amputated. He gets around great and is very active. He is afraid of small children.</p>  <p>Izod&amp;#39;s Foster mom says &amp;quot;Izod is a cool dude. He will lay on the couch or bed for hours and just chill while I am watching TV or on the computer. Then when I start to play he gets up for a bit of play time. He is more of the type that likes less play and more one on one so that he can get a rub down. He loves to be petted, but he can be a little moody if you do not approach him calmly with a sweet voice. &amp;quot;</p>  <p>A donation has been made to Canine Castaways by ACE Pet Resort to sponsor Izod in memory of Shelby Ann.</p>  <p>Fostered by: Toni</p>  <p>Located in: Venice</p>  <p><strong> <span style='color: #22b200;'>MEDICAL INFO: </span> </strong></p>  <p>The following has been done for this dog... - Basic Exam by Veterinarian - Spayed or Neutered - Heartworm Tested &amp;#40;NEGATIVE&amp;#41; - Placed on heartworm preventive - Basic Bloodwork &amp;#40;NORMAL&amp;#41; - Microchipped - Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication - Vaccinations - Placed on Advantage or Frontline for Fleas / Ticks</p>  <p><strong> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>ADOPTION DONATION: </span> </strong><strong>&amp;#36;150</strong></p>  <p>This adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including a 6 month supply of heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption.

We don't know how he ended up there, but when we were contacted about him we went and rescued him. Because of his ordeal and living wild, he was VERY fearful when we first got him. We have been working with him for 9 months now and he is still very shy - but he's ready for a REAL home. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Waldo is very sweet and affectionate and wants pets and closeness when he's comfortable. He's not a 'let's go on a walk' dog - he's a 'I'll sit on your lap and love on you if it's quiet' dog. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Waldo doesn't really have any training. He will need work on housebreaking and we recommend continuing crate training.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST:&amp;nbsp; Waldo needs an adult-only quiet home... preferrably with another well-adjusted dog or with someone who is home a lot. He needs lots of patience and TLC. &amp;#124;&amp;#124; CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Waldo would love to be with another well-adjusted dog his size... he's great with cats too. He is absolutely NOT recommended for children because he is so fearful. &amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application.

He was picked up by a Good Samaritan and taken to a vet where it was determined that while he was quite thin, he had not actually been hit. He was then relinquished to our organization so that we could find him a great home&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;PERSONALITY: Papi is SUPER cute. He is a bit shy in new situations - but not snippy like Chis can be. He likes to play, play, play - and is most definitely a lap doggie. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;TRAINING: Papi seems to be housebroken - he is a VERY good boy. He will need some work on leash training. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;WOULD DO BEST: Papi would do best in a home with some children to play with and/or another small dog. He is a super sweet little guy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Papi is fantastic with both cats and dogs - but lots of dogs &amp;#40;like a dog park&amp;#41; and large dogs make him nervous.&amp;nbsp; He would do great with kids over five years of age. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;VET RECORD :All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;AVAILABILITY: This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only. &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit our website: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/</a> &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Visit us on Facebook: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome' target='_blank'>http://www.facebook.com/foreverhome</a> &amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; &amp;nbsp;Make a donation to help us continue to save lives: <a href='http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html' target='_blank'>http://www.foreverhomepetrescue.org/donate.html</a></p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;4620900&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

I&amp;#39;m really a very happy and lovable little girl that enjoys playing with my male doggie friends. I love being petted and held - I&amp;#39;m really quite cuddly! My favorite thing to do is play fetch, especially with a squeaky toy!&amp;nbsp;I just love it! You throw it, I promise to bring it back. Got a pool&amp;#63; I love water! I splash and roll around. You can&amp;nbsp;teach me how to jump in and swim! My ITP peeps think I&amp;#39;m&amp;nbsp;the total package -&amp;nbsp;young, fun and cute as a button!

Coyote&amp;#41; and I am a 1 year old Pit Bull mix &amp;#40;possibly Pit Bull &amp;amp; Hound&amp;#41; that just loves to go walking, running, playing, exploring and getting attention. After ending up on the streets of LA, I was saved by a good Samaritan and was then picked up by a volunteer from Orange County. Since then, I have been living with him and his 2 foster Pit Bulls in Huntington Beach but I want to find my forever home. I have been neutered, crate trained and I have a clean bill of health. I love attention and I am super eager to gain some new commands. To date, I am potty trained and I understand my name, sit, come and no. I behave very well when on leash and I respond promptly to commands if a critter distracts me. I can be adopted by a single person or a family...more people to give me attention and play and I would love a playmate if you already have a dog. I just want someone or a family who has the time to give me attention and love. I would definitely prefer to live in a house with a yard but as long as I get walked I will be just fine.</p>  <p>If you think I would be a great addition to your family, contact my foster dad Paul at <a href='mailto:paulstiller&amp;#64;yahoo.com' target='_blank'>paulstiller&amp;#64;yahoo.com</a></p>  <p>I can&amp;#39;t wait to come home with you!</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8150567&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

        "description": "<p>Meet Tank! He is 2 years old and weighs 65lbs. He was found on the 110 and 105 freeway interchange with another abandoned dog. He was underweight, dirty, hungry, thirsty and desperate for love. Look at him now, he is just the sweetest boy! If you pet him for three seconds, he&amp;rsquo;ll sit, and then roll right over onto his back! He loves to play with his ball, and is learning to play fetch! He also loves to cuddle! He has a silvery tannish red coat and uniquely gorgeous light eyes! Tank is crate trained, house trained and knows his basic commands. Tank would do best being the only dog in a cat-free home.</p>  <p><br /> He is currently neutered, micro-chipped, vaccinated and ready to go to his forever home!<br /> Please contact Brittany at <a href='tel:&amp;#37;28310&amp;#37;29&amp;#37;20918-5348' target='_blank' value='&amp;#43;13109185348'>&amp;#40;310&amp;#41; 918-5348</a> or <a href='mailto:fraserbrittany&amp;#64;gmail.com' target='_blank'>fraserbrittany&amp;#64;gmail.com</a> if interested in fostering or giving Tank the loving home he deserves!</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8205804&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

Generally after birth these plates gradually fuse and become rigid. The last place to fill in and solidify is the spot at the top of the skull where the four skull plates meet. If these plates do not fuse, we are left with a soft, unprotected spot at the top of the head that is called an open fontanel. In some very tiny breeds the fontanel may never close. A fontanel usually closes by 8 weeks but can sometimes close by 6 months.<br /><br /> What if the Fontanel never Closes&amp;#63;<br /><br /> A dog with an open fontanel may have a serious medical problem called hydrocephalus &amp;#40;water on the brain&amp;#41;. Too much fluid on and in the brain creates pressure that effects development of the brain. Symptoms of hydrocephalus include seizures, blindness, lack of coordination, walking in circles, an large round dome on the head. There is no treatment for hydrocephalus.<br /><br /> Living with a dog who has an open Fontanel&amp;nbsp;</span></div> <div class='text_exposed_root text_exposed'>&amp;nbsp;</div> <div class='text_exposed_root text_exposed'><span class='text_exposed_show'>A puppy with an open fontanel can live out a normal life with certain precautions. They need to be in a home without other pets or small children. Care must be taken to avoid heavy grooming around the head, and any injury to the head. Keep in mind the puppy has no idea and will play rough and hard and perhaps fall from a stair or couch. If this happens unprotected spot could possibly cause serious brain injury.<br /> <br /></span></div><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8207576&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

She will go into a kennel but unless taken out regularly, she may have accidents. &amp;nbsp;Lucy is a very sweet girl who would love a family of her own. You will be hard-pressed to find a sweeter, more loving dog!! &amp;nbsp;Lucy is already spayed, current on shots and heartworm negative.</p>  <p>Prior to meeting or adopting one of our wonderful dogs, we ask that you please fill out our online Dog Adoption Application on our website&amp;nbsp;AAFlorida.org.&amp;nbsp; There is a link on the top of the home page. Click on &amp;quot;Fill in&amp;quot;, you don&amp;#39;t have to register.&amp;nbsp; For more information about this dog or any others, you can contact us at&amp;nbsp;ECAnimalAllies&amp;#64;gmail.com or 850-780-3223.&amp;nbsp; We are a foster organization and don&amp;#39;t have set hours we are open - but we will gladly set up an appointment for you to meet any dog.&amp;nbsp; Of course, you&amp;#39;re under no obligation to adopt if you come to meet any of our&amp;nbsp;sweet canines.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8224392&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

He would love to be on a farm to roam but would stay close by. Cam was flown up from North Carolina by Pilots and Paws and did great on the plane and does great in a car, just takes up a lot of space. We did his DNA and it came back with German Shepherd/Cavalier King Charles/Rottweiler hence his size. He knows basic commands by both saying and hand signals as well. He has lived on two different farms and got along with horses, goats, sheep and chickens. He loves people and wants to please. Due to his size he needs an active person/couple that understand how to handle a big dog. Older children only as he has the potential to knock a small child down without realizing it.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;8263492&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",

She is a fearless, smart puppy and loves all people and other dogs.</p> <p>Katie would be best in a home with another small, playful dog, and in a home where the owner is not gone all day.</p> <p>Katie and Clinton, our other puppy, would make a great pair if you are looking for two puppies.</p> <p>Katie is current on shots and will probably be between 10 and 12 pounds when she is full-grown.</p><img src=&amp;#34;https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet&amp;#63;6780432&amp;a=&amp;h=24911419&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; />",
